Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel.

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.",It's Barack Obama's fault that the Peace Process collapsed. ,0.41,0,0,12/02/2024 08:35,0,Neutral

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces.

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

It was very justifiable to the Arabs at the time, from their perspective, as they had the same views on the Jews as the Germans had in WW2. (arguably even worse views than the Germans had)

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

696,m058nor,1,"Anyone who thinks a few steps beyond the memes, infographs, dogma du jour at the unis, knows the Arabs/Hamas/Hezbollah would genocide all the Jews if they could. If they had the power/weaponry. *They've stated this over and over and over.* One side has better guns; that's it. Ideologically, they are likely more genocidal than the IDF/Lakud who, according to everything I've read, are still giving evacuation orders rather than just dropping bombs out of nowhere - at least, they try. Hamas gave no warnings on 10/7.

I'm sure there are some inhumane IDF soldier jerkoffs, as there are in any war. I'm not even saying the IDF/Israel is more noble than Arabs/Palestine. However to act as though Palestinians/Arabs are angels and Israelis/US is evil is utterly, utterly absurd. To call it ""settler colonialism"" when Jews are indigenous to Israel makes literally no sense.

The conflict is tragic, it's true. The UN partition was a crap deal for the Palestinians to a degree, and everything wasn't on the up and up. OK, fine. Go tell that to the history of history, which is brutal wars of conquest literally everywhere. The Palestinians were displaced in the Nakba. OK, but the Arabs launched a war first. And Palestinians weren't genocided. The Armenians were genocided by the Ottomans and the survivors were marched into the Syrian desert to die or to be displaced. Guess what? The Armenians didn't start death cults and terrorist groups to murder, rape, behead incident Turkish civilians. They lost tons of land. There is no right to return. They got their sh\*te together and moved on and got rich in the US.

This, team TikTok, is the history of history. Why are Palestinians allowed to brutally terrorize Israeli citizens 75+ years later? Does team TikTok and the US know world history - or even actual *current* geopolitics? Do they know that wars of conquests and displacement happens and that the victims move on?

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally.

You do realize there was an active ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah (I think it was signed in 2023) that they broke right?

https://x.com/MTVEnglishNews/status/1863159187968045521   

It seems fighting is still continuing by Israelis against Hezbollah.   

As far as I know, Israel couldn't negotiate a deal to end hezbollah but instead negotiated a deal to only move hezbollah north of the litani and not allow new weapon supplies, but it did not mention any ideas of disarming hezbollah north of the litani. This was the ceasefire terms agreed upon both sides.   

While it would have been better for Lebanese and for Israelis to have a deal ensuring disarming Hezbollah as a foreign backed militia in Lebanon, this was not the deal Israel was achieved.   

Ever since the ceasefire, Israel has continued attacks on what it claims are hezbollah targets, but they are doing so even north of the Litani river where the deal that both sides agreed to did not mention that hezbollah can't operate there.   

I'm afraid this will do nothing but put anyone who opposes hezbollah from the Lebanese side in a bad position because this would only prove that you can't trust israeli ceasefires and terms. This will only give hezbollah more reasons to remain legitimate and will dismiss any Lebanese efforts to take control.

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

I’d still like to believe that but much of what has happened in response to this conflict makes that hard. I’m not getting why,if not for antisemitism, are people are so anti-Zionist and why this conflict is so focussed on. I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement? 

And this isn’t the only conflict in the world. It’s not even the largest by people killed or involved. Here is a map that shows all current conflicts. https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker 

Most I hadn’t even heard of, but why no focus on the conflicts and genocide in Sudan where 25 million people need humanitarian aid and 12 million have been displaced? Why is the focus on Ukraine minimal when it is one if the most despicable wars ever with the potential of the collapse of Western society? 

People deny this is rooted in antisemitism and I want to believe they’re accurate, but in our community, we just can’t come up with any other reason! So if you are Anti-Zionist, what do you think Zionism is? Do we not have the right to self define? Is the definition offensive to you?

It seems fighting is still continuing by Israelis against Hezbollah.   

As far as I know, Israel couldn't negotiate a deal to end hezbollah but instead negotiated a deal to only move hezbollah north of the litani and not allow new weapon supplies, but it did not mention any ideas of disarming hezbollah north of the litani. This was the ceasefire terms agreed upon both sides.   

While it would have been better for Lebanese and for Israelis to have a deal ensuring disarming Hezbollah as a foreign backed militia in Lebanon, this was not the deal Israel was achieved.   

Ever since the ceasefire, Israel has continued attacks on what it claims are hezbollah targets, but they are doing so even north of the Litani river where the deal that both sides agreed to did not mention that hezbollah can't operate there.   

I'm afraid this will do nothing but put anyone who opposes hezbollah from the Lebanese side in a bad position because this would only prove that you can't trust israeli ceasefires and terms. This will only give hezbollah more reasons to remain legitimate and will dismiss any Lebanese efforts to take control.

[link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/israel-hezbollah-syria-ceasefire-gaza-world-central-kitchen/)

&gt; An Israeli airstrike on a car in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed five people, including employees of World Central Kitchen. The charity said it was ""urgently seeking more details"" after Israel's military said it targeted a WCK worker who was part of the Hamas attack that sparked the war.

&gt; Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites along Syria's border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said Saturday, testing a fragile, days-old ceasefire that has seen continued sporadic fire.

&gt; The military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria into Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect, which the military said was a violation of its terms. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities or Hezbollah.

Hezbollah smuggling arms is a clear violation of ceasefire terms

The alternative is literally total genocide.

No, that's majority vs minority opinion. 

The majority of pro-pal demonstrations are calling for ""from water to water Palestine will be arab"" (aka Jewish genocide), intifada (violence, terrorism, suicide bombings), slogans like ""Yemen Yemen make us proud, k*** another soldier now"", ""we are hamas"", or red triangles everywhere- which is both a holocaust symbol and how hamas marks its targets. 

Charming right?

Now. I'm not going to deny the khanists exit. But they are a fringe minority that everyone thinks is _nuts_

Otherwise the majority of pro-Israel protests are... singing Jewish songs. Peaceful ones. Some even named ""the song of peace"" or ""the hope""

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

It seems fighting is still continuing by Israelis against Hezbollah.   

As far as I know, Israel couldn't negotiate a deal to end hezbollah but instead negotiated a deal to only move hezbollah north of the litani and not allow new weapon supplies, but it did not mention any ideas of disarming hezbollah north of the litani. This was the ceasefire terms agreed upon both sides.   

While it would have been better for Lebanese and for Israelis to have a deal ensuring disarming Hezbollah as a foreign backed militia in Lebanon, this was not the deal Israel was achieved.   

Ever since the ceasefire, Israel has continued attacks on what it claims are hezbollah targets, but they are doing so even north of the Litani river where the deal that both sides agreed to did not mention that hezbollah can't operate there.   

I'm afraid this will do nothing but put anyone who opposes hezbollah from the Lebanese side in a bad position because this would only prove that you can't trust israeli ceasefires and terms. This will only give hezbollah more reasons to remain legitimate and will dismiss any Lebanese efforts to take control.

&gt; An Israeli airstrike on a car in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed five people, including employees of World Central Kitchen. The charity said it was ""urgently seeking more details"" after Israel's military said it targeted a WCK worker who was part of the Hamas attack that sparked the war.

&gt; Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites along Syria's border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said Saturday, testing a fragile, days-old ceasefire that has seen continued sporadic fire.

&gt; The military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria into Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect, which the military said was a violation of its terms. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities or Hezbollah.

Hezbollah smuggling arms is a clear violation of ceasefire terms

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office.

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that.

Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

If you think Gaza belongs to you, your property, you would not have flatten much of Gaza. I still think the current top Israeli leadership also doesnt want to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip.

1. Ben-Gurion and early zionists may have commented on Greater Israel. But time has changed, the current top leadership is no Ben-Gurion. Similarly, Trump is no Biden. The government policies will change depending on the leader and changes with the time.

2. Daniella Weiss, Ben-Gvir, Smotrich and other extreme right wings may be salivating at the idea of re-establishing Gush Katif settlements (formerly near Khan Yunis) in the southern Gaza Strip. But none of them were part of the former top Israeli war cabinet, and even currently they do not direct or lead the war. They may try, but this is not official government policy. 

I am trying to explain that is/was not the intention of Israel/IDF to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip. It’s kinda an ancient war maxime (idk what is it called), but you dont destroy the land/ all the buildings if you want to conquer itand considered that land belongs to you.

3. During WW2, Germany didnt destroy Paris. They tried when they were losing and evacuating, but not at the start. They wanted Paris to be intact. And you would too if you are conquering Paris. There is a suggestion (some might dispute it) that the German leader who cannot be named during WW2, did not REALLY wanted to conquer Britain. After defeating France, Germany thought Britain would make peace. There were lots of destruction during the Battle of Britain especially London.

4. US dropped nuclear bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, flatten them. US had no intention of permanently conquering Japan. US never saw Japan as part of US land. US wanted to end the war, and thought using nuclear bomb will do that, and it did, Japan surrendered. US was in Japan for a bit to sort things out then quickly handed over to a transitional Japanese government. US had no intention of conquering Japan.

5. US dropped more than 7.5 million tons of bombs in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. US had no intention of permanently conquering Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos. It’s easier to completely destroy something you dont want/need and even easier if you are not the one going to clean up the mess later down the line. See the pattern….Israel has no intention of funding the rebuilding of Gaza with Israeli money. But that doesnt mean Israel will prevent others from funding the rebuilding of Gaza, mainly from donations from USA, Europe, Arab, Muslim countries and rest of international world but not Israel.

6. I dont have the facts, can someone check how was the six days war fought in Jerusalem ? If my theory is correct, my prediction would be, there should be minimal destruction in Jerusalem. Israel wants/wanted Jerusalem, and to be intact, not flatten. See the difference with Gaza Strip. 

7. What is Jerusalem worth ? Saladdin replied Nothing, then said Everything. I am not saying its historically accurate, i wanted to emphasize how people think. Jerusalem is worth nothing and everything. You wont want to destroy something that valuable. 

8. At the beginning of the Ukraine war, did you noticed the Russia’s attack was very tactical and calculated…lets attack the telecommunication system, military bases, military airbase, railway lines etc… I think at this moment, Putin really thought Ukraine was part of Russia, so he wasnt intending to flatten Ukraine. But Putin’s invasion plans didnt go as plan, F£*&amp; it… then Russia started to change tactic and started to obliterate cities like Bahmut, Mariupol, Kharkiv, etc... Well, if Putin cant have Ukraine, nobody else can…. might as well flatten it. 

9. Even if any US states try to secede from USA, the US military is unlikely going to flatten their cities. Because Washington would have concluded that is part of US land, we shouldnt cause that much destruction. Not to mention the bad press, criticism, protests, etc… the people there are American citizens and they might have family and friends in other parts of the USA. If its not US land, well… I can tell you the approach will be very different.

10. These intentions are not static, and can change. Trump probably has a few ideas of his own and will start making changes next year. Currently, there is rumors that part of Gaza Strip in the north might be turned into a buffer zone by IDF. I think the reason is for security purpose, not for the purpose to annex and not to settle in Gaza.

I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

What they do not realise is that the opposite is true. Not only is defeat possible, but in Gaza, they are winning.

For one, countless anaylsts, including those in Israel have commented that Israel has already lost the war. And that it cannot beat Hamas or the Palestinian Joint-Operations Room.

[As early as last month,](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/israel-losing-netanyahu-wont-back-down-his-war-aims) the British defence think tank reported that:

&gt; Israel is not achieving its war aims against Hamas. First, it has only obtained a handful of the hostages. Some have been killed; the fates of many others are still unknown.

Second, Hamas has not been destroyed. Destruction of a terrorist organisation is difficult to measure. Some point to leadership decapitation. However, as Jenna Jordan has pointed out, attriting terrorist leaders seldom brings about their organisations’ collapse. Factors such as popular support, ideology and organisational structure play bigger roles in deciding these groups’ fates. Another measure used to determine if a terrorist group has been destroyed is if its territorial sphere has been reduced or removed. Israel has failed to deprive Hamas of the territory it governed prior to the war. Hamas has been battered in Gaza, but it is still a political force to be reckoned with. Unaffiliated Palestinian clans have refused to join in a post-war reconstruction effort for fear of retaliation by Hamas. Third, Israel has not been able to secure its borders. While it has regained control over some border crossings, the underground infrastructure that has allowed Hamas to engage in smuggling weapons and carrying out attacks is still in place.

[Analdou Agency reported that a former Mossad chief had stated that Israel was unequovically losing the war in Gaza.](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-on-losing-end-in-gaza-war-former-mossad-deputy-chief/3223179). Even Zionist publishers like [JP reported this](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-803955).

[As CNN has reported, Hamas has remained wholly combat effective.](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/08/middleeast/gaza-israel-hamas-battalions-invs-intl/). This is a pattern that staretd early in the war. By December, the IDF was declaring most Hamas batallions to have been dismantled.

This was quickly revealed to be a propaganda lie. As in early 2024, reports emerged that Hamas had begun rehabilitating its batallions in North Gaza. Reports from the Neo-Conservative think tank isw argued that as much as 80% of Hamas' fighting strength was restored. 

According to the isw's report on MArch 27th, they argue that this means Palestinian fighters ""retain  significant degree of combat effectiveness in the area, despite continued Israeli clearing efforts around Gaza City."" and that ""The return of Israeli forces to [Zaytoun] suggests that Palestinian militias continue to operate there similar to how these militias still have a presence in other portions of the northern Gaza Strip.""

We can also check pretty much every battle in Gaza to see how this is true.

The first battle in Gaza was the battle of Beit Hanoun. Despite IDF claims, they never occupied the city. And the battle is considered as having ended in a Palestinian victory. The isw reported that when the IDF left in December, the P-JOR continued effective control over Beit Hanoun. Beit Hanoun was used as a base to attack the IDF and send rockets into Israel, demonstrating that teh IDF had failed to defeat the JOR in Beit Hanoun.

Then we have the First Battle of Jabalia. As the isw reported, Hamas retained control of Jabalia after Israel withdrew in May. 

&gt; ""These points taken together reflect the degree to which Hamas and other Palestinian militias remain combat effective in and around Jabalia. Hamas and the other militias will almost certainly resume their efforts to reconstitute there as the IDF units have left.""

Then we have the Battle of Shuja'iyya. Though the IDF declared victory here, heavy casualties forced them to withdraw and as al-Jazeera reported, Palestinians retained control of the city. Further evidence of Palestinain control is that several months later, the IDF returned to the region to try and wrestle control away from the JOR.

This 2nd battle was just as disastrous for the IDF. After retreating in July, Hamas and the PIJ retained dominance in the city. Again, al-Jazeera reported how this had occured. But not stopping there, when the IDF withdrew in videos from the area one could see Palestinian militants with guns in their hands standing around in broad daylight. Alongside this, government officials working for the P-JOR immediately remerged in the city, as if they had never left, and reasserted doubly Palestinian control in the region.

Then we have the siege of Khan Yunis. The first Israeli assualt ended in abject failure. so great was the routing of the IDF they withdrew from all of southern Gaza. Khan Yunis itself remained under the control of the Joint Operations Room. Again, as reported by the isw. The 2nd and 3rd battles ended in much the same way and in far shorter timespans.

Then comes al-Qarara. By all acounts, a Palestinian victory.The isw reported that Israel was defeated in al-Qarara. They had failed to achieve any of their aims. P-JOR remained in control. No high ranking militants were found or killed, and accordinng to anaylsts, Hamas remained combat effective in the region.

This is how every battle that has ended thus far has gone. Israel went in, killed civilians for a few weeks. Ran into resistance, tried to fight back, upon seeing heavy casualties retreated with Palestine still in control.

This is not what victory looks like. Israel is, by all measures losing.","The evidence that Hamas is in fact, beating the IDF in Gaza",0.18,0,0,11/30/2024 16:33,0,Neutral

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

2733,m00s1ny,5,"Pretty much everything you write here is true, but somehow what Israel is doing to the Palestinians in the West Bank negates a great deal of it.   The Israeli occupation is awful and it’s difficult for any reasonable person to look at what the Palestinians living there have to endure without thinking they’re entitled to resist and ultimately win their freedom.   Any of us in their situation would do the same, albeit not by adopting the methods of October 7.

Israel’s ceaseless construction of more and more settlements in the West Bank while limiting  construction as well as free movement for the native Palestinian population there, penning them ever more tightly into multiple discontiguous and economically nonviable enclaves, has one clear aim to all the rest of us.   No nation settles an area with hundreds of thousands of people with the goal of ultimately, a generation or two later, giving it back as part of a negotiated peace.   And no, Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza two decades ago doesn’t prove the contrary; in contrast to the 9000 settlers removed from Gaza (amid huge controversy) there are now already 20,000 alone in the Israeli city of Ariel deep within the West Bank, representing only a tiny fraction of the nearly 450,000 altogether in the West Bank outside of East Jerusalem (another 200,000+). I don’t think you’re going to succeed in convincing any reasonable person that Israel will ever remove most of these settlers.

The ultimate goal is a land grab, which Israel might justify on many grounds, including national security, but certainly never as some sort of noble effort directed toward “peaceful coexistence” and/or basic respect for a younger Palestinian generation’s fundamental human rights.   To put it another way, the “Palestinian cause” gains a certain degree of “nobility” nowadays in large part as a consequence of Israel’s ignoble efforts to undermine their people’s narrative and permanently disable their future prospects.

Most of us can see what Israel is trying to do and, however much we disagree with the Palestinians’ forms of resistance as well as the oft-stated goal of eliminating the Jewish state, similarly disagree with the increasingly clear Israeli goal of eliminating any future prospect of a Palestinian state in favor of imposing an endless brutal occupation that predictably breeds exactly the sort of resistance it’s allegedly trying to suppress.

For people of good will on the outside, it’s perfectly possible to hold the belief that the Palestinians are entitled to their freedom without  somehow believing that the State of Israel needs to be undone.   You’ve said in some of your prior posts that you’re a believer in the TSS, but somehow I never see you actively defending the idea nowadays or suggesting practical measures to see it implemented someday.",IsraelPalestine,12/02/2024 11:34,1h4fkct,GreatConsequence7847,0,5,0,TRUE,08/09/2024 22:54,0,0,523,76,599,13,"Let me preface this by saying that my father is ethnically Jewish, and that roughly ten years ago, I studied Hebrew, read (bits of) the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, as well as Jewish writers such as Josephus and Philo Judaeus, with the plan being for me ultimately to convert to Judaism.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally.

Yet, despite this significant offer, none of the 101 hostages have been successfully returned so far. What makes this even more perplexing is the clear evidence that some of the hostages are being sheltered and cared for by Gazan civilians. This raises an unsettling question: how could a father, who has the chance to secure safety, a better future for his family, and an improved quality of life, choose instead to keep a hostage? 

This decision defies logic on multiple levels. It is not just about the economic or material benefits offered by Israel. The offer promises a lifeline, an escape from the hardships and dangers that many Gazan civilians face daily. Accepting such an offer would theoretically guarantee safety from ongoing conflicts, access to better healthcare and education, and a future of stability. Yet, the fact that no one has taken advantage of this opportunity suggests a deeper, more troubling dynamic at play.

It leads me to consider whether hatred toward Israelis surpasses the love for their own children among some Gazans. Is the hostility so deeply ingrained that it eclipses even the instinctual drive to protect and provide for their families? This possibility is deeply unsettling, as it speaks to a cycle of animosity that overrides self-preservation and the pursuit of a better life.

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

829,m04wkm7,1,"I feel the main mistake you're making is assuming Israel has some long-term scheme. As if it's some hivemind, or was always ruled by a single dictator. In reality, various Israelis have their own, competing strategic visions. Even within the same government, due to Israel's multiparty system. And on the other hand, there are national priorities, and the real life (diplomatic, economic, military) limitations. 

The settler movement doesn't want a two state solution, and believes that settlements would prevent it. But they have never managed to convince the Israeli public that the settlements, or tying Israel's hands in future negotiations are national priorities. At most, the Palestinians, not the settlers, have convinced Israelis that the settlements are not the thing that stands between them and peace. And Israeli withdrawals, while Palestinians are still yearning (as a matter of their #1 national priority) to eliminate Israel, will only lead to a lot of dead Israelis and Palestinians. But if these circumstances change, or somehow Israel's actual core motives are threatened, so will the public opinion.

As for bypass roads and whatnot: the vast majority of settlers are in small blocks next to your border, and in East Jerusalem. Removing the small settlements that dot the land doesn't mean removing half a million people. Nobody said that if the settlements aren't all removed, the Palestinians are left only with areas A and B. And even in the plans where they are left with those areas, like the Trump plan or Bennett's old proposal, they absolutely control roads and tunnels that connect between those pieces. And even if not, if there's peace, it's solvable with some sort of an agreement - as with the myriad of enclaves and exclaves within Baarle-Nassau, the second-level enclave between UAE and Oman, the insanity on the India-Bangladesh border etc. And I haven't mentioned other options, like an EU type of arrangement, where settlements and settlers remain in Palestine. Yes, it makes things harder. But no, none of this is fundamentally unsolvable, or inherently makes Palestinian statehood impossible.

169,m06l1kk,1,"""Settler colonialism"" &amp; ""ethnostate"" are hate labels created in the areas of political science, social science &amp; law by the oppression-ideology scholars, heavily funded by Qatar and other entities, who have swarmed into academia in recent decades. 

It's neo-Marxism, racialized Marxism, actually. Oppression ideology arises from Marxist and other socialist thinking where there's an oppressor class and a repressed class. The oppressors are evil and exploit the repressed underclass and feed parasitically off of them.

Modern oppression ideology racializes these ideas into racist constructs. (This is where the racial hatred of white people come from in recent years, where white men and women are treated as defective and owe atonement and reparations to black and brown peoples, regardless of their ancestry or what their forebears have done.)

In the areas of politics, law and social sciences, oppression ideology has taken forms expressed as hateful scholarship concepts like settler-colonialism and ethnostate and so on. These concepts are used to create or describe movements to ""violently decolonize"" regions of the world where whites have settled. And by ""violently decolonize"" I mean they espouse killing whites, like in Africa (the country formerly known as ""Rhodesia"" and now known as Zimbabwe and in South Africa) there are movements to wipe out the remaining whites.

These terms, and other racialized marxist ideations, have been weaponized against Israel by academic antisemites. They take several steps to apply them to Israel, like first deciding that Israelis are European whites (because a minority of Israeli Jews are descended those who returned from Europe after WWII) and not Semites/Levantine people.

The same antisemites who try to apply racialized settler-colonialism to demonize white heritage also claim that having a country for Jewish people to live is an ""ethnostate"" even though Jews are extremely ethnically diverse -- ranging from Black Ethiopian Jews to never-left-Israel natives to Jews from India, America &amp; so on. This is despite the fact that most nations are ethnically centered on one or a few heritage populations, from China and Japan to Germany.

The fact is that the oppression ideology based recent studies in politics, law &amp; social studies are all racist anti-white hatred and poor quality scholarship. The reason I say this is that they are applied &amp; built upon in extremely Eurocentric notions, as in stating their ideas in terms of radical hatred of European whites, as an indictment of European expansion and migration. 

In fact, the application of settler-colonialism seems to be applied exclusively to European expansion of the past few hundred years, ignoring all other human migration, empires, capliphates and dynasties in history.

For example, there's nothing implicitly wrong or incorrect with the basic concept of settler-colonialism. But to apply it strictly and obsessively to European expansion is to ignore all of the history of Islam. One of the most brutal, successful &amp; oppressive examples of settler-colonialism is the expansion of Islam out of the Arabian peninsula across the Levant region (where Israel lies) across N Africa and across the ME, up the Balkans &amp; across the Mediterranean to Spain. 

Basically, every wrongdoing in the ""settler-colonialism"" framework can be applied to Islamic-Arab expansion more than the European expansion, but the descendants of Arab Muslim settler-colonists are most of the very people accusing Europeans of it. For example, the Palestinian Arabs are descendants of the brutal settler-colonialism of the Levant, remnants of the invasion of Islamist Arabs as they swept across to N. Africa, raping, forcefully converting and killing along the way. 

Arab-Islamic settler-colonists heavily leveraged slavery to both repress locals and support their civilization's growth. In fact, the Ottoman Empire, the last great Islamic civilization, had to collapse after United States &amp; Europeans (who had started using chattel slavery for a few hundred years after Spain, which had been under Islamic rule for 800 years, introduced chattel slavery to Europe and the New World) abolished slavery among themselves and attacked and ended the Barbary Slave Trade in the 19th century.

The ""settler-colonial framework"" &amp; terms like ""ethnostate"" are the work that these racist Marxist antisemites &amp; anti-white minorities in academia, mostly disgruntled Muslims who pine for the return of a world ruled by a Global Islamic Caliphate, have weaponized against Europe, the U.S. and Israel in recent decades.

Their motivations and aims in what they do are evident in what they get from targeting wealthy nations with these smears: privileges, reparations, special treatment, diversity and inclusion quotas, immigration assistance and support, low-enforcement policing polices, and international aid -- vast amounts of international aid. 

In terms of Israel, the people claiming that Jews are ""settler-colonists""  also want to take what Jews have built in Israel and plunder it, when really, the Palestinian Arabs are settler-colonists who are resisting the return of Jews, the true ancestral indigenous people, to the land. 

Palestinian Arabs are the descendants of the first wave of (pre-modern) settler-colonists in the region who had plundered what was at the time a wealthy and connected Israel, and turned it to desert by destroying irrigation, settlements and forests, depopulating Israel, because the nomadic herding tribes who moved into the region out of Arabia preferred it that way.

Prior to the Islamic-Arab invasion and expansion, Israel's civilization had survived the invasion and conquest of many empires, from Greek and Roman to others. By desertifying Israel, the Arab nomadic herding tribes successfully depopulated it and made it easy to maintain control and ownership of it. Until Zionists began to return and reclaim the land to rebuild. 

You should know the terms about settler-colonialism and ethnostate and so on. 

These settler colonialism studies are to international law and politics what critical race theory is to U.S. law, politics and policing. They lie on a continuum of Marxist oppression ideologies that are the trend in academia supporting unchecked immigration/open borders, DEI and other reparations-minded agendas.

This is the newspeak of the academic &amp; cultural bubble that dominates in academia &amp; liberal circles today. If you don't know these terms you're believed to be part of the problem of white oppression of browns and blacks.

I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

Another measure used to determine if a terrorist group has been destroyed is if its territorial sphere has been reduced or removed. Israel has failed to deprive Hamas of the territory it governed prior to the war. Hamas has been battered in Gaza, but it is still a political force to be reckoned with. Unaffiliated Palestinian clans have refused to join in a post-war reconstruction effort for fear of retaliation by Hamas. Third, Israel has not been able to secure its borders. While it has regained control over some border crossings, the underground infrastructure that has allowed Hamas to engage in smuggling weapons and carrying out attacks is still in place.

[Analdou Agency reported that a former Mossad chief had stated that Israel was unequovically losing the war in Gaza.](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-on-losing-end-in-gaza-war-former-mossad-deputy-chief/3223179). Even Zionist publishers like [JP reported this](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-803955).

[As CNN has reported, Hamas has remained wholly combat effective.](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/08/middleeast/gaza-israel-hamas-battalions-invs-intl/). This is a pattern that staretd early in the war. By December, the IDF was declaring most Hamas batallions to have been dismantled.

This was quickly revealed to be a propaganda lie. As in early 2024, reports emerged that Hamas had begun rehabilitating its batallions in North Gaza. Reports from the Neo-Conservative think tank isw argued that as much as 80% of Hamas' fighting strength was restored. 

According to the isw's report on MArch 27th, they argue that this means Palestinian fighters ""retain  significant degree of combat effectiveness in the area, despite continued Israeli clearing efforts around Gaza City."" and that ""The return of Israeli forces to [Zaytoun] suggests that Palestinian militias continue to operate there similar to how these militias still have a presence in other portions of the northern Gaza Strip.""

We can also check pretty much every battle in Gaza to see how this is true.

The first battle in Gaza was the battle of Beit Hanoun. Despite IDF claims, they never occupied the city. And the battle is considered as having ended in a Palestinian victory. The isw reported that when the IDF left in December, the P-JOR continued effective control over Beit Hanoun. Beit Hanoun was used as a base to attack the IDF and send rockets into Israel, demonstrating that teh IDF had failed to defeat the JOR in Beit Hanoun.

Then we have the First Battle of Jabalia. As the isw reported, Hamas retained control of Jabalia after Israel withdrew in May. 

&gt; ""These points taken together reflect the degree to which Hamas and other Palestinian militias remain combat effective in and around Jabalia. Hamas and the other militias will almost certainly resume their efforts to reconstitute there as the IDF units have left.""

Then we have the Battle of Shuja'iyya. Though the IDF declared victory here, heavy casualties forced them to withdraw and as al-Jazeera reported, Palestinians retained control of the city. Further evidence of Palestinain control is that several months later, the IDF returned to the region to try and wrestle control away from the JOR.

This 2nd battle was just as disastrous for the IDF. After retreating in July, Hamas and the PIJ retained dominance in the city. Again, al-Jazeera reported how this had occured. But not stopping there, when the IDF withdrew in videos from the area one could see Palestinian militants with guns in their hands standing around in broad daylight. Alongside this, government officials working for the P-JOR immediately remerged in the city, as if they had never left, and reasserted doubly Palestinian control in the region.

Then we have the siege of Khan Yunis. The first Israeli assualt ended in abject failure. so great was the routing of the IDF they withdrew from all of southern Gaza. Khan Yunis itself remained under the control of the Joint Operations Room. Again, as reported by the isw. The 2nd and 3rd battles ended in much the same way and in far shorter timespans.

Then comes al-Qarara. By all acounts, a Palestinian victory.The isw reported that Israel was defeated in al-Qarara. They had failed to achieve any of their aims. P-JOR remained in control. No high ranking militants were found or killed, and accordinng to anaylsts, Hamas remained combat effective in the region.

This is how every battle that has ended thus far has gone. Israel went in, killed civilians for a few weeks. Ran into resistance, tried to fight back, upon seeing heavy casualties retreated with Palestine still in control.

This is not what victory looks like. Israel is, by all measures losing.","The evidence that Hamas is in fact, beating the IDF in Gaza",0.18,0,0,11/30/2024 16:33,1,Pro-Israel

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

It seems fighting is still continuing by Israelis against Hezbollah.   

As far as I know, Israel couldn't negotiate a deal to end hezbollah but instead negotiated a deal to only move hezbollah north of the litani and not allow new weapon supplies, but it did not mention any ideas of disarming hezbollah north of the litani. This was the ceasefire terms agreed upon both sides.   

While it would have been better for Lebanese and for Israelis to have a deal ensuring disarming Hezbollah as a foreign backed militia in Lebanon, this was not the deal Israel was achieved.   

Ever since the ceasefire, Israel has continued attacks on what it claims are hezbollah targets, but they are doing so even north of the Litani river where the deal that both sides agreed to did not mention that hezbollah can't operate there.   

I'm afraid this will do nothing but put anyone who opposes hezbollah from the Lebanese side in a bad position because this would only prove that you can't trust israeli ceasefires and terms. This will only give hezbollah more reasons to remain legitimate and will dismiss any Lebanese efforts to take control.     
   
   
EDIT: From one of the replies:

[link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/israel-hezbollah-syria-ceasefire-gaza-world-central-kitchen/)

&gt; An Israeli airstrike on a car in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed five people, including employees of World Central Kitchen. The charity said it was ""urgently seeking more details"" after Israel's military said it targeted a WCK worker who was part of the Hamas attack that sparked the war.

&gt; Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites along Syria's border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said Saturday, testing a fragile, days-old ceasefire that has seen continued sporadic fire.

&gt; The military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria into Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect, which the military said was a violation of its terms. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities or Hezbollah.

Hezbollah smuggling arms is a clear violation of ceasefire terms

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

 In April 1920, after the Ottoman defeat, the World War I Allies partitioned Greater Syria into British and French mandates. The [mandate systems ](https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/mandate-system), was basically a system where each mandate (partition of land from a former empire), would temporarily be governed by one of the countries that won the war, with the ultimate goal being to create a new country for its inhabitants. So the Northern half of Greater Syria was given to the French to temporarily administer, and the southern half of Greater Syria was given to the British to temporarily administer. 

Zionism was a product of its time. In an error where empires were crumbling, and land from those empires was being split up to form new nations, Zionism became the belief that just one tiny partition of the many partitions being newly formed from the Ottoman Empire, should be a national homeland for the Jews, containing at least some of our indigenous land (even ‘European’ Jews) are indigenous, we were kicked out by [Rome in 73 AD](https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/australianoutlook/israel-and-palestine-where-should-history-begin-and-should-it-matter/)), or and that the Arabs (who’d later call themselves Palestinians) living in the land should be offered a choice between citizenship with equal rights, or be compensated if they’d rather leave. 

The British agreed to this and so in 1920, they divided up the southern half of Greater Syria into the Trans Jordan mandate to be a be future Arab state, and the Palestine Mandate to be a future Jewish state. The French split the northern half, into the Lebanon Mandate, and the Syrian Mandate. Jews who had been living scattered around the Ottoman Empire for generations, had been involved in the Zionist movement from the beginning. The amount of land that was set aside for the Palestine Mandate per Jew living in the Ottoman, was about 1/7th the amount of land set aside for the Arab states per Arab living in the Ottoman. 

Now the Arabs who had been living in the newly formed Palestine Mandate, who had been living in that land for generations, [weren’t very happy](https://www.miryaminstitute.org/commentary-blog/the-palestinian-issue-is-about-supremacy-not-justice?) about all the Jewish Immigrants coming in, and having to choose between moving to the trans Jordan Mandate, or becoming an ethnic minority in a future Jewish State. 

[“On August 23 1929, amid anti-Jewish riots in much of Palestine, sixty-seven Jewish residents of Hebron were brutally murdered by Palestinian Arabs, with some of the victims being raped, tortured, or mutilated.”](https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/israel/hebron6-03.htm)

[“For Palestinians, 1929 was one of the first significant actions against the expanding Zionist movement. For Jews, the Hebron massacre, where 68 Jews were killed by rioters, was one of the bloodiest attacks they suffered under British Mandatory Palestine.”](https://www.islamicity.org/92992/1929-palestinian-riots/)

[“In April 1936, the newly formed Arab National Committee called on Palestinians to launch a general strike, withhold tax payments and boycott Jewish products to protest British colonialism and growing Jewish immigration.”](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/9/whats-the-israel-palestine-conflict-about-a-simple-guide)

So then Britain stopped allowing Jewish immigration to the Palestine Mandate in order to pacify the Palestinian Arabs. And then 6million Jews (1/3 of the worlds Jewish population) was killed in the holocaust.

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.",It's Barack Obama's fault that the Peace Process collapsed. ,0.41,0,0,12/02/2024 08:35,0,Neutral

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally.

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

But we then imagine a world where defending oneself doesn't involve killing *any* innocents alongside necessary targets, to separate ourselves from our above belief and the real ""on the ground"" outcome of it. That's just not the world. I can't say whether or not Israel could have killed fewer innocents in this process- I lack the military intel needed for that and wasn't in the room when decisions had to be made to be able to say a reasonable person in the same shoes would've chosen differently- but I can say for certain the moment you believe self defense is allowed that you believe killing innocents is allowed in some amount. Because that's the reality of the situation, and most wars between neighboring peoples (only seems to not be the case for powers so far from the fighting their civilians cannot be touched, eg America in Vietnam).

It is not wrong to believe self defense is a right- because it is, and we would all do it if it came down to our own lives and we would expect that of our own country. But in doing so you must realize you condone- albeit regretfully and wishing war was not the case I'm sure- the potential and likely inevitable killing of innocents to some degree... including children. Though certainly separation of targets from civilian infrastructure does help to limit this risk.

If you think Gaza belongs to you, your property, you would not have flatten much of Gaza. I still think the current top Israeli leadership also doesnt want to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip.

1. Ben-Gurion and early zionists may have commented on Greater Israel. But time has changed, the current top leadership is no Ben-Gurion. Similarly, Trump is no Biden. The government policies will change depending on the leader and changes with the time.

2. Daniella Weiss, Ben-Gvir, Smotrich and other extreme right wings may be salivating at the idea of re-establishing Gush Katif settlements (formerly near Khan Yunis) in the southern Gaza Strip. But none of them were part of the former top Israeli war cabinet, and even currently they do not direct or lead the war. They may try, but this is not official government policy. 

I am trying to explain that is/was not the intention of Israel/IDF to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip. It’s kinda an ancient war maxime (idk what is it called), but you dont destroy the land/ all the buildings if you want to conquer itand considered that land belongs to you.

3. During WW2, Germany didnt destroy Paris. They tried when they were losing and evacuating, but not at the start. They wanted Paris to be intact. And you would too if you are conquering Paris. There is a suggestion (some might dispute it) that the German leader who cannot be named during WW2, did not REALLY wanted to conquer Britain. After defeating France, Germany thought Britain would make peace. There were lots of destruction during the Battle of Britain especially London.

4. US dropped nuclear bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, flatten them. US had no intention of permanently conquering Japan. US never saw Japan as part of US land. US wanted to end the war, and thought using nuclear bomb will do that, and it did, Japan surrendered. US was in Japan for a bit to sort things out then quickly handed over to a transitional Japanese government. US had no intention of conquering Japan.

5. US dropped more than 7.5 million tons of bombs in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. US had no intention of permanently conquering Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos. It’s easier to completely destroy something you dont want/need and even easier if you are not the one going to clean up the mess later down the line. See the pattern….Israel has no intention of funding the rebuilding of Gaza with Israeli money. But that doesnt mean Israel will prevent others from funding the rebuilding of Gaza, mainly from donations from USA, Europe, Arab, Muslim countries and rest of international world but not Israel.

6. I dont have the facts, can someone check how was the six days war fought in Jerusalem ? If my theory is correct, my prediction would be, there should be minimal destruction in Jerusalem. Israel wants/wanted Jerusalem, and to be intact, not flatten. See the difference with Gaza Strip. 

7. What is Jerusalem worth ? Saladdin replied Nothing, then said Everything. I am not saying its historically accurate, i wanted to emphasize how people think. Jerusalem is worth nothing and everything. You wont want to destroy something that valuable. 

8. At the beginning of the Ukraine war, did you noticed the Russia’s attack was very tactical and calculated…lets attack the telecommunication system, military bases, military airbase, railway lines etc… I think at this moment, Putin really thought Ukraine was part of Russia, so he wasnt intending to flatten Ukraine. But Putin’s invasion plans didnt go as plan, F£*&amp; it… then Russia started to change tactic and started to obliterate cities like Bahmut, Mariupol, Kharkiv, etc... Well, if Putin cant have Ukraine, nobody else can…. might as well flatten it. 

9. Even if any US states try to secede from USA, the US military is unlikely going to flatten their cities. Because Washington would have concluded that is part of US land, we shouldnt cause that much destruction. Not to mention the bad press, criticism, protests, etc… the people there are American citizens and they might have family and friends in other parts of the USA. If its not US land, well… I can tell you the approach will be very different.

I would argue that the biggest failure happened after Hamas was elected in 2006. Hamas is a terror org and we wouldn’t fund them as a government. Seemingly overnight, they separated the PA as the receiver or aid to distribute. Had the international community put actual restrictions on the aid, they could have forced things
to avoid the us vs them on aid to West Bank va Gaza. This would have set a completed diff picture for future administrations including Obama. 

I was dating an Israeli Arab who is an American citizen living in the states for 13 years. He cried for his people the night Hamas was elected.

To re-start the Peace Process, Netanyahu accepted a 2 state solution in Bar Ilan and later halted settlement construction, which damaged him in his Political Base

[https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna34151442](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna34151442)

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.",It's Barack Obama's fault that the Peace Process collapsed. ,0.41,0,0,12/02/2024 08:35,0,Neutral

How did the settlement of West Bank start?

So again, in light of the recent history of Israel, I am going to trust the fanaticism of Mrs Weiss and her terrorists far more than a hopeful yet clueless Israeli liberal. No offense intended.

1. Ben-Gurion and early zionists may have commented on Greater Israel. But time has changed, the current top leadership is no Ben-Gurion. Similarly, Trump is no Biden. The government policies will change depending on the leader and changes with the time.

2. Daniella Weiss, Ben-Gvir, Smotrich and other extreme right wings may be salivating at the idea of re-establishing Gush Katif settlements (formerly near Khan Yunis) in the southern Gaza Strip.

I am trying to explain that is/was not the intention of Israel/IDF to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip. It’s kinda an ancient war maxime (idk what is it called), but you dont destroy the land/ all the buildings if you want to conquer itand considered that land belongs to you.

To re-start the Peace Process, Netanyahu accepted a 2 state solution in Bar Ilan and later halted settlement construction, which damaged him in his Political Base

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.",It's Barack Obama's fault that the Peace Process collapsed. ,0.41,0,0,12/02/2024 08:35,0,Neutral

4781,lzvkkbq,3,"The founding idea of the state of Israel was to give Jews independence from foreign rule and a place in which they could rule themselves. It was founded in an era in which the major global empires were crumbling and the prevailing idea was that nation states, sovereign states reflecting the self determination of national groups (that is that share a history, language, culture etc) would replace empires. Such processes were happening all over the world. Nation states often had minorities within them too, but still reflected the national interests of the majority. This process was bloody and had mixed and complex results.

There are two approaches to national liberation: independence and integration into a larger polity. Both the Jewish community and the international community weighed both options and both came to the conclusion that independence for the Jews in some boundary within Palestine was the best option. The Palestinian Arabs disagreed, but the majority within their national movement were not pushing for national integration with Jewish residents of Palestine either. 

The PLO in its founding document explained that only Jews who lived in Palestine before “the Zionist invasion” (ie 1882), meaning the vast majority of Jews were not included and wouldn’t be when Palestinians reclaimed the territory from the river to the sea. (Note the PLO has stepped back from this, and has replaced that strategy for trying to undo Jewish sovereignty in any part of the land by pushing for the right of return of descendants of refugees from the 1948 war as well as evacuation of Jews from the West Bank. The effect is that they are pushing for national independence in the West Bank and Gaza but integration in the Green Line, which means no independence for Jews anywhere on the globe. And note today the PLO does not the majority, with the largest faction being Hamas, who favors killing or expelling most Jews from anywhere in historic Palestine and integrating (likely as a subjugated dhimmi status) a small number of Jews. 

In this context, independence for Jews is still the preferable option. And independence means being able to choose who lives in your territory.

For example, let’s say Navajos (a cultural linguistic minority in the US) decided collectively that independence was the best course of action for their national interest and they succeed in obtaining independence from the US, then for them to effectively benefit from such independence, they would have to be a majority in the territory they govern, and white Americans (the majority in the region) would not be able to move to the independent Navajo nation by right. Some white Americans may resent such a policy as racist, but it would be necessary to maintain self determination of the Navajo. Of course for Navajo, that’s not the course they or the US has taken, rather mostly focused on integration into American society with some limited autonomy.",IsraelPalestine,12/01/2024 14:53,1h3q07k,Complete-Proposal729,0,3,0,TRUE,10/19/2021 6:42,185,0,1512,34232,35929,0,"I'm trying to find any information I might be overlooking.  I know the general idea was to create a place where Jews would be safe, and I suppose that's the main reason to keep a Jewish majority. 

But are there other reasons?  Maybe some scriptural basis for needing to be majority Jewish?  I can't find any so far.  There's certainly a scriptural basis for the idea of Jews having a *connection* to the land of Israel, but there's nothing I've found in the Jewish tradition/scriture that says Jews need to be in the majority. 

Or maybe something totally different? I know Israel was *planned* as a Jewish state by the UN partition plan, same as Pakistan was planned as a Muslim state.. 

I'm not challenging the idea that it should be majority Jewish. (There's basically no such thing as a state whose native ethnic people has not remained in the majority -- France, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Germany, especially Japan, etc., all remain something like 85%-95% ethnically homogeneous.

Israelis often feel they're unfairly targeted for their nationality and that you if you're Israeli or shows any Israeli culture literally anywhere, you'll receive harsh criticism, if not outright hatred.



This is absolutely the case. You simply can't even mention Israel at all, or talk about the cutlure of Tel Aviv or Haifa today, without people directly saying that it's all Palestinian land, you're all settlers, etc. It's simply impossible to just share you like Hebrew music or modern Israeli couscous without people bringing up the conflict.


This is especially the case if you're in any context with many people from Middle Eastern, Arab or Muslim people. They aren't known to tolerate people saying they're Israeli.


The same is also true for left-wing activist groups in the West.



It feels really unfair because most other nationalities and ethnicities can simply talk about where they're from without getting an automatic harsh reaction, but they can't. Their very existance is political.



While it's often definitely very related to antisemitism, it's also often motivated by something else, namely, geopolitics and ethnic conflicts.



The thing is, the legitimacy of the State of Israel is not uninamous. Some believe it's not a legitimate state, and it's all an illegal occupation of the sovereign country of Palestine.


You might personally believe it's outrageous and unacceptable, but it's most likely because you grew up in a context where Israel being a state isn't questioned.


But in the Arab World for example most people don't believe Israel is a legitimate state.


But the thing is, the same treatment is often given to people from other disputed or unrecognised regions or states.



For example Abkhazia, it's a partially recognised state in the Caucasus claimed by Georgia as its autonomous region. It declared secession after an ethnic conflict in the 1990s and most of the world doesn't recognise it, except for Russia.


The thing is that the same applies to Abkhazians and any, even apolitical posts about Abkhazia.



If you want to share anything happening in modern day Abkhazia, for example about some caves found there, or about their recent protests there, or their food and culture, people would inevitably bring up Georgia.





And in fact, the vast majority of people will be on the opposing side, and they won't have many people defending them and if not being on their side, at least trying to bring up nuance.


[Ironically, this happens even for people who are themselves citizens of an unrecognised state.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kosovo/comments/1eoar1h/i_want_to_relocate_from_abkhazia_to_kosovo_how_is/)


The problem isn't just that Georgians outnumber Abkhazians (like the Arab World outnumbers Israel) but rather that people that are not directly tied to the conflict will automatically take a side because this will be seen as a proxy for their politics in general. For Abkhazia, the major Western powers (for example the EU) massively support Georgia, and people in the West are against Abkhazia because they believe backing Georgia means being against Russian imperialism.


I've seen it myself, any people who try to bring any nuance to this conflict, even if they're Abkhazian themselves, are accused of being pro Russian. Same with Israel too, in some cases.


Meanwhile, for Israel, left-wing activist circles believe that Israel is a settler colonial state, therefore backing Palestinians at all times is backing decolonization.



Both of these conflicts are actually much more complex than this simplistic narrative, but people don't actually try to learn that, they take sides automatically based on some narrative they've heard.


But because of this politization, merely saying you live in Israel or Abkhazia or are Abkhazian, as opposed to Georgian for example, is seen as itself a political statement.


If you live in Sukhumi and you say you're Abkhazian, even though it's the norm in your society, and saying you're Georgian is as unacceptable as a Georgian saying they're Russian, you're told that if you want to participate in the modern world, you should say you're Georgian and live in Georgia. The same is true for Israelis. If you live in Jaffa, how can you say it's an Israeli city? And use this symbol 🇮🇱 which is very political? For the Palestinians whose family is from there, it can be offensive.


And yes, you can be seen as a settler because the state you live in is seen as illegitimate.


This is very problematic.




All that often also happens with people from other disputed regions or states (Kosovo, South Ossetia, Northern Cyprus, Crimea, Kashmir, Tibet, etc).



Personally, I feel like in both cases, this approach doesn't necessarily help people to actually resolve ethnic conflicts. Instead of actually trying to build ties and create a solution that'll satisfy everyone, for example by strengthening the opposition. For example pro Palestinian people could've supported the Israeli opposition and the Israeli diaspora itself could've been supportive of a Palestinian state and even a right of return. But no, instead, we obsess over the legality of borders and the legitimacy of states, which means people on the opposite side see us as an existential threat to their existance.









We say we're modern people but in reality we're still tribal creatures, unfortunately.


Geopolitics, governments, state sovereignity and independence is unfortunately very ingrained in all of us and it's arguably like modern day religion.



It's sad to fight against this because this doesn't become merely discrimination, but also a geopolitical opinion opposing this state, and it's very hard to draw the lines over what's acceptable and what's not. But often times, people who say that racism is unacceptable still say unacceptable things merely because of the nationality of the person.



**However, unfortunately, this is something that's very common right now and is seen as the natural thing to do. So I've created this post to try to explain the logic of those that oppose anyone automatically if they say they're ""Israelis"", to understand their motivations, to know how to possibly fight against them, and also to oppose similar situations in the Western World, where entire identities become politicised.**



In my opinion, we should really deconstruct the idea of states and nations if we actually want to achieve world peace, or at least strive towards it.


I think we should be much more mindful about how national identities shape our worldview and how people from ""disputed regions"" might still be first and foremost people and we should try to look beyond merely borders and nations, be it recognised or not.




I also believe we shouldn't see the world merely through a lense of ""states"" and ""nations"". I believe the videos and maps about ""X fun thing in every country in the world"" (for example food, music, architecture, fun facts, etc) should also include people without states or with disputed states and that it shouldn't be seen as inherently political. So yeah, including Israel, Palestine, Abkhazia, Tibet, Hawaii, Ingushetia, Tamil Nadu, Jewish diaspora etc. If our world wasn't so fixated on ""countries"", aka, sovereign states, these things would've been much less problematic.

Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

There’s a reason Amnesty Intl has been widely criticized by many scholars and countries for years (and no, I’m not just talking about criticism for/from Zionism, Jews, Israelis, but many countries) for one-sided narratives, leaving out key history, and deliberate misinformation. 

Had the Arab League not invaded in a war of extermination, there would be displacement but nowhere near that amount, and half of the 700k that were displaced were not forcible displacement but from the Arab League telling them to leave for the war, and others out of fear. Had the Arabs also accepted their state it still would’ve been even less as it would’ve been much swapping of Jewish and Arab villages as they both formed their new states side by side. 

Why would Germany be giving their land? Do you think Zionism started in 1945? Modern Zionism movement was from the late 1800s, even Hebrew University was formed by Albert Einstein back in 1918, but proposed in 1884 during the modern Zionism movement. Were Jews only persecuted in WW2 or was it millennia of persecution and forced expulsion? 

It would be entirely unreasonable for Germany to be forced to take on all the Jews that had migrated and been forced out for the centuries prior to WW2. 

Why do you think the Hebron Massacre happened in the 1920s if Zionism movement of fleeing persecution for safety is somehow about being post-1945?

I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

Hi everyone! I host a podcast called *Israel &amp; Palestine Unpacked* ([listen here](https://open.spotify.com/show/2o0vVS6BuKrZ21NYxiGsgB)). I’m reaching out to Israelis and Palestinians who are willing to share their personal stories for an upcoming series of episodes. 

The purpose of the podcast is to foster meaningful dialogue and shed light on the human experiences that define life in Israel and Palestine. Through a series of personal stories, we aim to showcase the realities faced by individuals as they navigate their daily lives in this complex region. Each 30-minute episode offers an in-depth exploration of these narratives, featuring interviews with both an Israeli and a Palestinian. Together, they share their perspectives on profound topics such as identity, resilience, and hope, revealing the shared humanity that connects us all.

We’d love to hear your perspective, especially if you’ve experienced the following, but not limited to:

* **Crossing borders and checkpoints**: How does this shape your daily life?
* **Parenting during conflict**: How do you raise children in such challenging environments?
* **Living in mixed or segregated communities**: What are the realities of these spaces?
* **Friendships across divides**: How do you build and maintain connections?
* **Sports**: Can it unite people, or does it create more division?
* **Experiences of conflict**: How has this impacted your perspective?
* **Dreams and aspirations**: What do you hope for your future and your community?
* **Media and misinformation**: How does it shape perceptions and realities in the region?

I know these topics can be deeply personal and emotional, but your story matters. Sharing your perspective can challenge stereotypes, bridge divides, and foster greater empathy among listeners around the world.

If you’re interested or know someone who might be, please send me a private message. Every voice has value, and together, we can create something impactful.

1829,m02r5a8,1,"It's really upsetting how people live under Israeli occupation, but the fact is that a fully independent Palestine would immediately erupt into a civil war with factions funded by Iran and other groups.

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

The messed up thing with Palestine is that Britain deliberately prevented them from forming their own government because they did not want them to set any immigration limits because they wanted to increase the Jewish population in that area. 

This [1978 UN report on the conflict](https://www.un.org/unispal/history2/origins-and-evolution-of-the-palestine-problem/part-i-1917-1947) concludes with the following quote:

&gt;“All through those 30 years, Britain (admitted) into Palestine, year by year, a quota of Jewish immigrants that varied according to the strength of the respective pressures of the Arabs and Jews at the time. These immigrants could not have come in if they had not been shielded by a British chevaux-de-frise. If Palestine had remained under Ottoman Turkish rule, or if it had become an independent Arab state in 1918, Jewish immigrants would never have been admitted into Palestine in large enough numbers to enable them to overwhelm the Palestinian Arabs in this Arab people’s own country. **The reason why the State of Israel exists today and why today 1,500,000 Palestinian Arabs are refugees is that, for 30 years, Jewish immigration was imposed on the Palestinian Arabs by British military power until the immigrants were sufficiently numerous and sufficiently well-armed to be able to fend for themselves with tanks and planes of their own.** The tragedy in Palestine is not just a local one; it is a tragedy for the world, because it is an injustice that is a menace to the world’s peace.” 1",IsraelPalestine,12/02/2024 08:19,1h4mvic,impactedturd,0,-4,0,TRUE,7/22/2020 3:15,211,33,792,50759,51795,59,"I grew up for 40 years thinking mass antisemitism was a thing of the past.

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.",It's Barack Obama's fault that the Peace Process collapsed. ,0.41,0,0,12/02/2024 08:35,0,Neutral

For one, countless anaylsts, including those in Israel have commented that Israel has already lost the war. And that it cannot beat Hamas or the Palestinian Joint-Operations Room.

[As early as last month,](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/israel-losing-netanyahu-wont-back-down-his-war-aims) the British defence think tank reported that:

&gt; Israel is not achieving its war aims against Hamas. First, it has only obtained a handful of the hostages. Some have been killed; the fates of many others are still unknown.

Second, Hamas has not been destroyed. Destruction of a terrorist organisation is difficult to measure. Some point to leadership decapitation. However, as Jenna Jordan has pointed out, attriting terrorist leaders seldom brings about their organisations’ collapse. Factors such as popular support, ideology and organisational structure play bigger roles in deciding these groups’ fates. Another measure used to determine if a terrorist group has been destroyed is if its territorial sphere has been reduced or removed. Israel has failed to deprive Hamas of the territory it governed prior to the war. Hamas has been battered in Gaza, but it is still a political force to be reckoned with. Unaffiliated Palestinian clans have refused to join in a post-war reconstruction effort for fear of retaliation by Hamas. Third, Israel has not been able to secure its borders. While it has regained control over some border crossings, the underground infrastructure that has allowed Hamas to engage in smuggling weapons and carrying out attacks is still in place.

[Analdou Agency reported that a former Mossad chief had stated that Israel was unequovically losing the war in Gaza.](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-on-losing-end-in-gaza-war-former-mossad-deputy-chief/3223179). Even Zionist publishers like [JP reported this](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-803955).

[As CNN has reported, Hamas has remained wholly combat effective.](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/08/middleeast/gaza-israel-hamas-battalions-invs-intl/). This is a pattern that staretd early in the war. By December, the IDF was declaring most Hamas batallions to have been dismantled.

This was quickly revealed to be a propaganda lie. As in early 2024, reports emerged that Hamas had begun rehabilitating its batallions in North Gaza. Reports from the Neo-Conservative think tank isw argued that as much as 80% of Hamas' fighting strength was restored. 

According to the isw's report on MArch 27th, they argue that this means Palestinian fighters ""retain  significant degree of combat effectiveness in the area, despite continued Israeli clearing efforts around Gaza City."" and that ""The return of Israeli forces to [Zaytoun] suggests that Palestinian militias continue to operate there similar to how these militias still have a presence in other portions of the northern Gaza Strip.""

We can also check pretty much every battle in Gaza to see how this is true.

The first battle in Gaza was the battle of Beit Hanoun. Despite IDF claims, they never occupied the city. And the battle is considered as having ended in a Palestinian victory. The isw reported that when the IDF left in December, the P-JOR continued effective control over Beit Hanoun. Beit Hanoun was used as a base to attack the IDF and send rockets into Israel, demonstrating that teh IDF had failed to defeat the JOR in Beit Hanoun.

Then we have the First Battle of Jabalia. As the isw reported, Hamas retained control of Jabalia after Israel withdrew in May. 

&gt; ""These points taken together reflect the degree to which Hamas and other Palestinian militias remain combat effective in and around Jabalia. Hamas and the other militias will almost certainly resume their efforts to reconstitute there as the IDF units have left.""

Then we have the Battle of Shuja'iyya. Though the IDF declared victory here, heavy casualties forced them to withdraw and as al-Jazeera reported, Palestinians retained control of the city. Further evidence of Palestinain control is that several months later, the IDF returned to the region to try and wrestle control away from the JOR.

This 2nd battle was just as disastrous for the IDF. After retreating in July, Hamas and the PIJ retained dominance in the city. Again, al-Jazeera reported how this had occured. But not stopping there, when the IDF withdrew in videos from the area one could see Palestinian militants with guns in their hands standing around in broad daylight. Alongside this, government officials working for the P-JOR immediately remerged in the city, as if they had never left, and reasserted doubly Palestinian control in the region.

Then we have the siege of Khan Yunis. The first Israeli assualt ended in abject failure. so great was the routing of the IDF they withdrew from all of southern Gaza. Khan Yunis itself remained under the control of the Joint Operations Room. Again, as reported by the isw. The 2nd and 3rd battles ended in much the same way and in far shorter timespans.

Then comes al-Qarara. By all acounts, a Palestinian victory.The isw reported that Israel was defeated in al-Qarara. They had failed to achieve any of their aims. P-JOR remained in control. No high ranking militants were found or killed, and accordinng to anaylsts, Hamas remained combat effective in the region.

This is how every battle that has ended thus far has gone. Israel went in, killed civilians for a few weeks. Ran into resistance, tried to fight back, upon seeing heavy casualties retreated with Palestine still in control.

This is not what victory looks like. Israel is, by all measures losing.","The evidence that Hamas is in fact, beating the IDF in Gaza",0.18,0,0,11/30/2024 16:33,0,Pro-Palestine

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

https://x.com/MTVEnglishNews/status/1863159187968045521   

It seems fighting is still continuing by Israelis against Hezbollah.   

As far as I know, Israel couldn't negotiate a deal to end hezbollah but instead negotiated a deal to only move hezbollah north of the litani and not allow new weapon supplies, but it did not mention any ideas of disarming hezbollah north of the litani. This was the ceasefire terms agreed upon both sides.   

While it would have been better for Lebanese and for Israelis to have a deal ensuring disarming Hezbollah as a foreign backed militia in Lebanon, this was not the deal Israel was achieved.   

Ever since the ceasefire, Israel has continued attacks on what it claims are hezbollah targets, but they are doing so even north of the Litani river where the deal that both sides agreed to did not mention that hezbollah can't operate there.   

I'm afraid this will do nothing but put anyone who opposes hezbollah from the Lebanese side in a bad position because this would only prove that you can't trust israeli ceasefires and terms. This will only give hezbollah more reasons to remain legitimate and will dismiss any Lebanese efforts to take control.

[link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/israel-hezbollah-syria-ceasefire-gaza-world-central-kitchen/)

&gt; An Israeli airstrike on a car in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed five people, including employees of World Central Kitchen. The charity said it was ""urgently seeking more details"" after Israel's military said it targeted a WCK worker who was part of the Hamas attack that sparked the war.

&gt; Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites along Syria's border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said Saturday, testing a fragile, days-old ceasefire that has seen continued sporadic fire.

&gt; The military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria into Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect, which the military said was a violation of its terms. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities or Hezbollah.

Hezbollah smuggling arms is a clear violation of ceasefire terms

I’m mostly now of the opinion that of course Israel should defend itself but I can’t justify the killing of so many innocents.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

What they do not realise is that the opposite is true. Not only is defeat possible, but in Gaza, they are winning.

For one, countless anaylsts, including those in Israel have commented that Israel has already lost the war. And that it cannot beat Hamas or the Palestinian Joint-Operations Room.

[As early as last month,](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/israel-losing-netanyahu-wont-back-down-his-war-aims) the British defence think tank reported that:

&gt; Israel is not achieving its war aims against Hamas. First, it has only obtained a handful of the hostages. Some have been killed; the fates of many others are still unknown.

Second, Hamas has not been destroyed. Destruction of a terrorist organisation is difficult to measure. Some point to leadership decapitation. However, as Jenna Jordan has pointed out, attriting terrorist leaders seldom brings about their organisations’ collapse. Factors such as popular support, ideology and organisational structure play bigger roles in deciding these groups’ fates. Another measure used to determine if a terrorist group has been destroyed is if its territorial sphere has been reduced or removed. Israel has failed to deprive Hamas of the territory it governed prior to the war. Hamas has been battered in Gaza, but it is still a political force to be reckoned with. Unaffiliated Palestinian clans have refused to join in a post-war reconstruction effort for fear of retaliation by Hamas. Third, Israel has not been able to secure its borders. While it has regained control over some border crossings, the underground infrastructure that has allowed Hamas to engage in smuggling weapons and carrying out attacks is still in place.

[Analdou Agency reported that a former Mossad chief had stated that Israel was unequovically losing the war in Gaza.](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-on-losing-end-in-gaza-war-former-mossad-deputy-chief/3223179). Even Zionist publishers like [JP reported this](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-803955).

[As CNN has reported, Hamas has remained wholly combat effective.](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/08/middleeast/gaza-israel-hamas-battalions-invs-intl/). This is a pattern that staretd early in the war. By December, the IDF was declaring most Hamas batallions to have been dismantled.

This was quickly revealed to be a propaganda lie. As in early 2024, reports emerged that Hamas had begun rehabilitating its batallions in North Gaza. Reports from the Neo-Conservative think tank isw argued that as much as 80% of Hamas' fighting strength was restored. 

According to the isw's report on MArch 27th, they argue that this means Palestinian fighters ""retain  significant degree of combat effectiveness in the area, despite continued Israeli clearing efforts around Gaza City."" and that ""The return of Israeli forces to [Zaytoun] suggests that Palestinian militias continue to operate there similar to how these militias still have a presence in other portions of the northern Gaza Strip.""

We can also check pretty much every battle in Gaza to see how this is true.

The first battle in Gaza was the battle of Beit Hanoun. Despite IDF claims, they never occupied the city. And the battle is considered as having ended in a Palestinian victory. The isw reported that when the IDF left in December, the P-JOR continued effective control over Beit Hanoun. Beit Hanoun was used as a base to attack the IDF and send rockets into Israel, demonstrating that teh IDF had failed to defeat the JOR in Beit Hanoun.

Then we have the First Battle of Jabalia. As the isw reported, Hamas retained control of Jabalia after Israel withdrew in May. 

&gt; ""These points taken together reflect the degree to which Hamas and other Palestinian militias remain combat effective in and around Jabalia. Hamas and the other militias will almost certainly resume their efforts to reconstitute there as the IDF units have left.""

Then we have the Battle of Shuja'iyya. Though the IDF declared victory here, heavy casualties forced them to withdraw and as al-Jazeera reported, Palestinians retained control of the city. Further evidence of Palestinain control is that several months later, the IDF returned to the region to try and wrestle control away from the JOR.

This 2nd battle was just as disastrous for the IDF. After retreating in July, Hamas and the PIJ retained dominance in the city. Again, al-Jazeera reported how this had occured. But not stopping there, when the IDF withdrew in videos from the area one could see Palestinian militants with guns in their hands standing around in broad daylight. Alongside this, government officials working for the P-JOR immediately remerged in the city, as if they had never left, and reasserted doubly Palestinian control in the region.

Then we have the siege of Khan Yunis. The first Israeli assualt ended in abject failure. so great was the routing of the IDF they withdrew from all of southern Gaza. Khan Yunis itself remained under the control of the Joint Operations Room. Again, as reported by the isw. The 2nd and 3rd battles ended in much the same way and in far shorter timespans.

Then comes al-Qarara. By all acounts, a Palestinian victory.The isw reported that Israel was defeated in al-Qarara. They had failed to achieve any of their aims. P-JOR remained in control. No high ranking militants were found or killed, and accordinng to anaylsts, Hamas remained combat effective in the region.

This is how every battle that has ended thus far has gone. Israel went in, killed civilians for a few weeks. Ran into resistance, tried to fight back, upon seeing heavy casualties retreated with Palestine still in control.

If you think Gaza belongs to you, your property, you would not have flatten much of Gaza. I still think the current top Israeli leadership also doesnt want to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip.

1. Ben-Gurion and early zionists may have commented on Greater Israel. But time has changed, the current top leadership is no Ben-Gurion. Similarly, Trump is no Biden. The government policies will change depending on the leader and changes with the time.

2. Daniella Weiss, Ben-Gvir, Smotrich and other extreme right wings may be salivating at the idea of re-establishing Gush Katif settlements (formerly near Khan Yunis) in the southern Gaza Strip. But none of them were part of the former top Israeli war cabinet, and even currently they do not direct or lead the war. They may try, but this is not official government policy. 

I am trying to explain that is/was not the intention of Israel/IDF to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip. It’s kinda an ancient war maxime (idk what is it called), but you dont destroy the land/ all the buildings if you want to conquer itand considered that land belongs to you.

3. During WW2, Germany didnt destroy Paris. They tried when they were losing and evacuating, but not at the start. They wanted Paris to be intact. And you would too if you are conquering Paris. There is a suggestion (some might dispute it) that the German leader who cannot be named during WW2, did not REALLY wanted to conquer Britain. After defeating France, Germany thought Britain would make peace. There were lots of destruction during the Battle of Britain especially London.

4. US dropped nuclear bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, flatten them. US had no intention of permanently conquering Japan. US never saw Japan as part of US land. US wanted to end the war, and thought using nuclear bomb will do that, and it did, Japan surrendered. US was in Japan for a bit to sort things out then quickly handed over to a transitional Japanese government. US had no intention of conquering Japan.

5. US dropped more than 7.5 million tons of bombs in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. US had no intention of permanently conquering Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos. It’s easier to completely destroy something you dont want/need and even easier if you are not the one going to clean up the mess later down the line. See the pattern….Israel has no intention of funding the rebuilding of Gaza with Israeli money. But that doesnt mean Israel will prevent others from funding the rebuilding of Gaza, mainly from donations from USA, Europe, Arab, Muslim countries and rest of international world but not Israel.

6. I dont have the facts, can someone check how was the six days war fought in Jerusalem ? If my theory is correct, my prediction would be, there should be minimal destruction in Jerusalem. Israel wants/wanted Jerusalem, and to be intact, not flatten. See the difference with Gaza Strip. 

7. What is Jerusalem worth ? Saladdin replied Nothing, then said Everything. I am not saying its historically accurate, i wanted to emphasize how people think. Jerusalem is worth nothing and everything. You wont want to destroy something that valuable. 

8. At the beginning of the Ukraine war, did you noticed the Russia’s attack was very tactical and calculated…lets attack the telecommunication system, military bases, military airbase, railway lines etc… I think at this moment, Putin really thought Ukraine was part of Russia, so he wasnt intending to flatten Ukraine. But Putin’s invasion plans didnt go as plan, F£*&amp; it… then Russia started to change tactic and started to obliterate cities like Bahmut, Mariupol, Kharkiv, etc... Well, if Putin cant have Ukraine, nobody else can…. might as well flatten it. 

9. Even if any US states try to secede from USA, the US military is unlikely going to flatten their cities. Because Washington would have concluded that is part of US land, we shouldnt cause that much destruction. Not to mention the bad press, criticism, protests, etc… the people there are American citizens and they might have family and friends in other parts of the USA. If its not US land, well… I can tell you the approach will be very different.

10. These intentions are not static, and can change. Trump probably has a few ideas of his own and will start making changes next year. Currently, there is rumors that part of Gaza Strip in the north might be turned into a buffer zone by IDF. I think the reason is for security purpose, not for the purpose to annex and not to settle in Gaza.

You can swallow the lies from the Hamas 'Health Ministry' all you like, but it's worth remembering that even if their figures were 100% accurate, no one asked them to invade Israel and slaughter around 1,500 innocents.   They decided that all on their own.  Maybe doing so wasn't the smartest thing that they've ever done.  What did they expect would be Israel's response?   The answer is that they knew that Israel would come after them, and hard.  They knew that people would die on both sides, and they knew that within a couple of days of Israel's response, the West would forget why the war had started, and would start to whine about 'innocent casualties'.

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things.

I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

Israelis often feel they're unfairly targeted for their nationality and that you if you're Israeli or shows any Israeli culture literally anywhere, you'll receive harsh criticism, if not outright hatred.



This is absolutely the case. You simply can't even mention Israel at all, or talk about the cutlure of Tel Aviv or Haifa today, without people directly saying that it's all Palestinian land, you're all settlers, etc. It's simply impossible to just share you like Hebrew music or modern Israeli couscous without people bringing up the conflict.


This is especially the case if you're in any context with many people from Middle Eastern, Arab or Muslim people. They aren't known to tolerate people saying they're Israeli.


The same is also true for left-wing activist groups in the West.



It feels really unfair because most other nationalities and ethnicities can simply talk about where they're from without getting an automatic harsh reaction, but they can't. Their very existance is political.



While it's often definitely very related to antisemitism, it's also often motivated by something else, namely, geopolitics and ethnic conflicts.



The thing is, the legitimacy of the State of Israel is not uninamous. Some believe it's not a legitimate state, and it's all an illegal occupation of the sovereign country of Palestine.


You might personally believe it's outrageous and unacceptable, but it's most likely because you grew up in a context where Israel being a state isn't questioned.


But in the Arab World for example most people don't believe Israel is a legitimate state.


But the thing is, the same treatment is often given to people from other disputed or unrecognised regions or states.



For example Abkhazia, it's a partially recognised state in the Caucasus claimed by Georgia as its autonomous region. It declared secession after an ethnic conflict in the 1990s and most of the world doesn't recognise it, except for Russia.


The thing is that the same applies to Abkhazians and any, even apolitical posts about Abkhazia.



If you want to share anything happening in modern day Abkhazia, for example about some caves found there, or about their recent protests there, or their food and culture, people would inevitably bring up Georgia.





And in fact, the vast majority of people will be on the opposing side, and they won't have many people defending them and if not being on their side, at least trying to bring up nuance.


[Ironically, this happens even for people who are themselves citizens of an unrecognised state.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kosovo/comments/1eoar1h/i_want_to_relocate_from_abkhazia_to_kosovo_how_is/)


The problem isn't just that Georgians outnumber Abkhazians (like the Arab World outnumbers Israel) but rather that people that are not directly tied to the conflict will automatically take a side because this will be seen as a proxy for their politics in general. For Abkhazia, the major Western powers (for example the EU) massively support Georgia, and people in the West are against Abkhazia because they believe backing Georgia means being against Russian imperialism.


I've seen it myself, any people who try to bring any nuance to this conflict, even if they're Abkhazian themselves, are accused of being pro Russian. Same with Israel too, in some cases.


Meanwhile, for Israel, left-wing activist circles believe that Israel is a settler colonial state, therefore backing Palestinians at all times is backing decolonization.



Both of these conflicts are actually much more complex than this simplistic narrative, but people don't actually try to learn that, they take sides automatically based on some narrative they've heard.


But because of this politization, merely saying you live in Israel or Abkhazia or are Abkhazian, as opposed to Georgian for example, is seen as itself a political statement.


If you live in Sukhumi and you say you're Abkhazian, even though it's the norm in your society, and saying you're Georgian is as unacceptable as a Georgian saying they're Russian, you're told that if you want to participate in the modern world, you should say you're Georgian and live in Georgia. The same is true for Israelis. If you live in Jaffa, how can you say it's an Israeli city? And use this symbol 🇮🇱 which is very political? For the Palestinians whose family is from there, it can be offensive.


And yes, you can be seen as a settler because the state you live in is seen as illegitimate.


This is very problematic.




All that often also happens with people from other disputed regions or states (Kosovo, South Ossetia, Northern Cyprus, Crimea, Kashmir, Tibet, etc).



Personally, I feel like in both cases, this approach doesn't necessarily help people to actually resolve ethnic conflicts. Instead of actually trying to build ties and create a solution that'll satisfy everyone, for example by strengthening the opposition. For example pro Palestinian people could've supported the Israeli opposition and the Israeli diaspora itself could've been supportive of a Palestinian state and even a right of return. But no, instead, we obsess over the legality of borders and the legitimacy of states, which means people on the opposite side see us as an existential threat to their existance.









We say we're modern people but in reality we're still tribal creatures, unfortunately.


Geopolitics, governments, state sovereignity and independence is unfortunately very ingrained in all of us and it's arguably like modern day religion.



It's sad to fight against this because this doesn't become merely discrimination, but also a geopolitical opinion opposing this state, and it's very hard to draw the lines over what's acceptable and what's not. But often times, people who say that racism is unacceptable still say unacceptable things merely because of the nationality of the person.



**However, unfortunately, this is something that's very common right now and is seen as the natural thing to do. So I've created this post to try to explain the logic of those that oppose anyone automatically if they say they're ""Israelis"", to understand their motivations, to know how to possibly fight against them, and also to oppose similar situations in the Western World, where entire identities become politicised.**



In my opinion, we should really deconstruct the idea of states and nations if we actually want to achieve world peace, or at least strive towards it.


I think we should be much more mindful about how national identities shape our worldview and how people from ""disputed regions"" might still be first and foremost people and we should try to look beyond merely borders and nations, be it recognised or not.




I also believe we shouldn't see the world merely through a lense of ""states"" and ""nations"". I believe the videos and maps about ""X fun thing in every country in the world"" (for example food, music, architecture, fun facts, etc) should also include people without states or with disputed states and that it shouldn't be seen as inherently political. So yeah, including Israel, Palestine, Abkhazia, Tibet, Hawaii, Ingushetia, Tamil Nadu, Jewish diaspora etc. If our world wasn't so fixated on ""countries"", aka, sovereign states, these things would've been much less problematic.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies.

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things.

The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

I know the general idea was to create a place where Jews would be safe, and I suppose that's the main reason to keep a Jewish majority. 

But are there other reasons?  Maybe some scriptural basis for needing to be majority Jewish?  I can't find any so far.  There's certainly a scriptural basis for the idea of Jews having a *connection* to the land of Israel, but there's nothing I've found in the Jewish tradition/scriture that says Jews need to be in the majority. 

Or maybe something totally different? I know Israel was *planned* as a Jewish state by the UN partition plan, same as Pakistan was planned as a Muslim state.. 

I'm not challenging the idea that it should be majority Jewish. (There's basically no such thing as a state whose native ethnic people has not remained in the majority -- France, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Germany, especially Japan, etc., all remain something like 85%-95% ethnically homogeneous.  So I don't see anything strange about Jews being the majority in Israel.) 

So I'm not asking ""why"" as a way to criticize Israel.  I'm searching for all the possible reasons why any stakeholders want to keep it majority Jewish.

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally .

With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not.

What they do not realise is that the opposite is true. Not only is defeat possible, but in Gaza, they are winning.

For one, countless anaylsts, including those in Israel have commented that Israel has already lost the war. And that it cannot beat Hamas or the Palestinian Joint-Operations Room.

[As early as last month,](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/israel-losing-netanyahu-wont-back-down-his-war-aims) the British defence think tank reported that:

&gt; Israel is not achieving its war aims against Hamas. First, it has only obtained a handful of the hostages. Some have been killed; the fates of many others are still unknown.

Second, Hamas has not been destroyed. Destruction of a terrorist organisation is difficult to measure. Some point to leadership decapitation. However, as Jenna Jordan has pointed out, attriting terrorist leaders seldom brings about their organisations’ collapse. Factors such as popular support, ideology and organisational structure play bigger roles in deciding these groups’ fates. Another measure used to determine if a terrorist group has been destroyed is if its territorial sphere has been reduced or removed. Israel has failed to deprive Hamas of the territory it governed prior to the war. Hamas has been battered in Gaza, but it is still a political force to be reckoned with. Unaffiliated Palestinian clans have refused to join in a post-war reconstruction effort for fear of retaliation by Hamas. Third, Israel has not been able to secure its borders. While it has regained control over some border crossings, the underground infrastructure that has allowed Hamas to engage in smuggling weapons and carrying out attacks is still in place.

[Analdou Agency reported that a former Mossad chief had stated that Israel was unequovically losing the war in Gaza.](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-on-losing-end-in-gaza-war-former-mossad-deputy-chief/3223179). Even Zionist publishers like [JP reported this](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-803955).

[As CNN has reported, Hamas has remained wholly combat effective.](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/08/middleeast/gaza-israel-hamas-battalions-invs-intl/). This is a pattern that staretd early in the war. By December, the IDF was declaring most Hamas batallions to have been dismantled.

This was quickly revealed to be a propaganda lie. As in early 2024, reports emerged that Hamas had begun rehabilitating its batallions in North Gaza. Reports from the Neo-Conservative think tank isw argued that as much as 80% of Hamas' fighting strength was restored. 

According to the isw's report on MArch 27th, they argue that this means Palestinian fighters ""retain  significant degree of combat effectiveness in the area, despite continued Israeli clearing efforts around Gaza City."" and that ""The return of Israeli forces to [Zaytoun] suggests that Palestinian militias continue to operate there similar to how these militias still have a presence in other portions of the northern Gaza Strip.""

We can also check pretty much every battle in Gaza to see how this is true.

The first battle in Gaza was the battle of Beit Hanoun. Despite IDF claims, they never occupied the city. And the battle is considered as having ended in a Palestinian victory. The isw reported that when the IDF left in December, the P-JOR continued effective control over Beit Hanoun. Beit Hanoun was used as a base to attack the IDF and send rockets into Israel, demonstrating that teh IDF had failed to defeat the JOR in Beit Hanoun.

Then we have the First Battle of Jabalia. As the isw reported, Hamas retained control of Jabalia after Israel withdrew in May. 

&gt; ""These points taken together reflect the degree to which Hamas and other Palestinian militias remain combat effective in and around Jabalia. Hamas and the other militias will almost certainly resume their efforts to reconstitute there as the IDF units have left.""

Then we have the Battle of Shuja'iyya. Though the IDF declared victory here, heavy casualties forced them to withdraw and as al-Jazeera reported, Palestinians retained control of the city. Further evidence of Palestinain control is that several months later, the IDF returned to the region to try and wrestle control away from the JOR.

This 2nd battle was just as disastrous for the IDF. After retreating in July, Hamas and the PIJ retained dominance in the city. Again, al-Jazeera reported how this had occured. But not stopping there, when the IDF withdrew in videos from the area one could see Palestinian militants with guns in their hands standing around in broad daylight. Alongside this, government officials working for the P-JOR immediately remerged in the city, as if they had never left, and reasserted doubly Palestinian control in the region.

Then we have the siege of Khan Yunis. The first Israeli assualt ended in abject failure. so great was the routing of the IDF they withdrew from all of southern Gaza. Khan Yunis itself remained under the control of the Joint Operations Room. Again, as reported by the isw. The 2nd and 3rd battles ended in much the same way and in far shorter timespans.

Then comes al-Qarara. By all acounts, a Palestinian victory.The isw reported that Israel was defeated in al-Qarara. They had failed to achieve any of their aims. P-JOR remained in control. No high ranking militants were found or killed, and accordinng to anaylsts, Hamas remained combat effective in the region.

I’d still like to believe that but much of what has happened in response to this conflict makes that hard. I’m not getting why,if not for antisemitism, are people are so anti-Zionist and why this conflict is so focussed on. I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement? 

And this isn’t the only conflict in the world. It’s not even the largest by people killed or involved. Here is a map that shows all current conflicts. https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker 

Most I hadn’t even heard of, but why no focus on the conflicts and genocide in Sudan where 25 million people need humanitarian aid and 12 million have been displaced? Why is the focus on Ukraine minimal when it is one if the most despicable wars ever with the potential of the collapse of Western society? 

People deny this is rooted in antisemitism and I want to believe they’re accurate, but in our community, we just can’t come up with any other reason! So if you are Anti-Zionist, what do you think Zionism is? Do we not have the right to self define? Is the definition offensive to you?

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.",It's Barack Obama's fault that the Peace Process collapsed. ,0.41,0,0,12/02/2024 08:35,0,Neutral

I’d still like to believe that but much of what has happened in response to this conflict makes that hard. I’m not getting why,if not for antisemitism, are people are so anti-Zionist and why this conflict is so focussed on. I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement? 

And this isn’t the only conflict in the world. It’s not even the largest by people killed or involved. Here is a map that shows all current conflicts. https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker 

Most I hadn’t even heard of, but why no focus on the conflicts and genocide in Sudan where 25 million people need humanitarian aid and 12 million have been displaced? Why is the focus on Ukraine minimal when it is one if the most despicable wars ever with the potential of the collapse of Western society? 

People deny this is rooted in antisemitism and I want to believe they’re accurate, but in our community, we just can’t come up with any other reason! So if you are Anti-Zionist, what do you think Zionism is? Do we not have the right to self define? Is the definition offensive to you?

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return.

Many Palestinians are mentally stuck in the year 1948, never acknowledged the existence of Israel (on any territory), and believe history can be reversed. while in Israel the term is not even used anymore, the goal of Zionism was achieved in 1948. The people who want to build settlements in Gaza and annex the West Bank are not referred to as zionists- they are messianic right-wing settlers. Most ""zionists"" would be glad to see a two-state solution and wouldn't mind giving up settlements in the West Bank in a future deal. Besides we see sometimes the use of the term zionist as a cover-up for the word ""Jew"". American Jew who believes Israel should exist? The average pro-Palestinian can call you a dirty zionist without being blamed for being antisemitic. while in reality, we can't erase the fact that half of the world's Jewish population live in Israel and more than 90% of the world's Jews believe it should exist (and that doesn't mean agreeing to the government's action or supporting what's happening in Gaza and the west bank)",IsraelPalestine,12/03/2024 09:53,1h4mvic,Heavy_Ad5500,0,1,0,TRUE,11/09/2023 02:03,0,0,1,60,61,59,"I grew up for 40 years thinking mass antisemitism was a thing of the past. I’d still like to believe that but much of what has happened in response to this conflict makes that hard. I’m not getting why,if not for antisemitism, are people are so anti-Zionist and why this conflict is so focussed on. I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement? 

And this isn’t the only conflict in the world. It’s not even the largest by people killed or involved. Here is a map that shows all current conflicts. https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker

People deny this is rooted in antisemitism and I want to believe they’re accurate, but in our community, we just can’t come up with any other reason!

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

What they do not realise is that the opposite is true. Not only is defeat possible, but in Gaza, they are winning.

For one, countless anaylsts, including those in Israel have commented that Israel has already lost the war. And that it cannot beat Hamas or the Palestinian Joint-Operations Room.

[As early as last month,](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/israel-losing-netanyahu-wont-back-down-his-war-aims) the British defence think tank reported that:

&gt; Israel is not achieving its war aims against Hamas. First, it has only obtained a handful of the hostages. Some have been killed; the fates of many others are still unknown.

Second, Hamas has not been destroyed. Destruction of a terrorist organisation is difficult to measure. Some point to leadership decapitation. However, as Jenna Jordan has pointed out, attriting terrorist leaders seldom brings about their organisations’ collapse. Factors such as popular support, ideology and organisational structure play bigger roles in deciding these groups’ fates. Another measure used to determine if a terrorist group has been destroyed is if its territorial sphere has been reduced or removed. Israel has failed to deprive Hamas of the territory it governed prior to the war. Hamas has been battered in Gaza, but it is still a political force to be reckoned with. Unaffiliated Palestinian clans have refused to join in a post-war reconstruction effort for fear of retaliation by Hamas. Third, Israel has not been able to secure its borders. While it has regained control over some border crossings, the underground infrastructure that has allowed Hamas to engage in smuggling weapons and carrying out attacks is still in place.

[Analdou Agency reported that a former Mossad chief had stated that Israel was unequovically losing the war in Gaza.](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-on-losing-end-in-gaza-war-former-mossad-deputy-chief/3223179). Even Zionist publishers like [JP reported this](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-803955).

[As CNN has reported, Hamas has remained wholly combat effective.](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/08/middleeast/gaza-israel-hamas-battalions-invs-intl/). This is a pattern that staretd early in the war. By December, the IDF was declaring most Hamas batallions to have been dismantled.

This was quickly revealed to be a propaganda lie. As in early 2024, reports emerged that Hamas had begun rehabilitating its batallions in North Gaza. Reports from the Neo-Conservative think tank isw argued that as much as 80% of Hamas' fighting strength was restored. 

According to the isw's report on MArch 27th, they argue that this means Palestinian fighters ""retain  significant degree of combat effectiveness in the area, despite continued Israeli clearing efforts around Gaza City."" and that ""The return of Israeli forces to [Zaytoun] suggests that Palestinian militias continue to operate there similar to how these militias still have a presence in other portions of the northern Gaza Strip.""

We can also check pretty much every battle in Gaza to see how this is true.

The first battle in Gaza was the battle of Beit Hanoun. Despite IDF claims, they never occupied the city. And the battle is considered as having ended in a Palestinian victory. The isw reported that when the IDF left in December, the P-JOR continued effective control over Beit Hanoun. Beit Hanoun was used as a base to attack the IDF and send rockets into Israel, demonstrating that teh IDF had failed to defeat the JOR in Beit Hanoun.

Then we have the First Battle of Jabalia. As the isw reported, Hamas retained control of Jabalia after Israel withdrew in May. 

&gt; ""These points taken together reflect the degree to which Hamas and other Palestinian militias remain combat effective in and around Jabalia. Hamas and the other militias will almost certainly resume their efforts to reconstitute there as the IDF units have left.""

Then we have the Battle of Shuja'iyya. Though the IDF declared victory here, heavy casualties forced them to withdraw and as al-Jazeera reported, Palestinians retained control of the city. Further evidence of Palestinain control is that several months later, the IDF returned to the region to try and wrestle control away from the JOR.

This 2nd battle was just as disastrous for the IDF. After retreating in July, Hamas and the PIJ retained dominance in the city. Again, al-Jazeera reported how this had occured. But not stopping there, when the IDF withdrew in videos from the area one could see Palestinian militants with guns in their hands standing around in broad daylight. Alongside this, government officials working for the P-JOR immediately remerged in the city, as if they had never left, and reasserted doubly Palestinian control in the region.

Then we have the siege of Khan Yunis. The first Israeli assualt ended in abject failure. so great was the routing of the IDF they withdrew from all of southern Gaza. Khan Yunis itself remained under the control of the Joint Operations Room. Again, as reported by the isw. The 2nd and 3rd battles ended in much the same way and in far shorter timespans.

Then comes al-Qarara. By all acounts, a Palestinian victory.The isw reported that Israel was defeated in al-Qarara. They had failed to achieve any of their aims. P-JOR remained in control. No high ranking militants were found or killed, and accordinng to anaylsts, Hamas remained combat effective in the region.

This is how every battle that has ended thus far has gone. Israel went in, killed civilians for a few weeks. Ran into resistance, tried to fight back, upon seeing heavy casualties retreated with Palestine still in control.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well.

The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally.

109,m06oyk5,1,"There are honest answers as to why those terms are used, and there are the ones given in 99% of cases. The honest answers go like this:

'Settler-Colonial' - while Jews indeed were a community in Palestine for thousands of years, it is also undeniable that the Zionist movement included, by the vast majority, Ashkenazi Jews from Western and Eastern Europe, with the influx of those populations being perceived, understandably so, as a colonial effort by some vague Western power. Was it? Not really, there was no Metropol to speak of, no nation that established a colony in a classical understanding. Was there a movement of European Jews moving into Palestine and settling there? Yes, of course, it's a historical fact. Whether it's appropriate to call it a ""settler-colonial"" venture is debatable and really depends on the person's understanding of that term. The later influx of Mizrahim, Middle-Eastern Jews, in even larger numbers paints this situation differently as well, but I wouldn't necessarily call that part of the directed Zionist effort the same way it was with the European Jews.

""Ethnostate"" - people have a natural aversion to the concept, since it assumes, and necessarily includes some manner of ethnic discrimination in an effort to maintain the majority of a single group. Nobody likes ethnicity-based discrimination for understandable reasons. But, there are also historical realities like the entire Middle East being almost exclusively Ethnostates, whether implicitly or explicitly, and the existence of very understandable justifications for the continuous maintenance of a Jewish demographic majority in a state built for Jews, by Jews, or other justifications for such practices that would be accepted by reasonable people.

The answers given most often however are boring and come from a place of anti-semitism, or obsession with power dynamics, or plain foolishness and lack of understanding of the concepts. Anything with the word ""colonial"" is assumed to be evil incarnate, an Imperial force dominating indigenous people, stealing their natural resources and land, and treating them as 2nd class citisens, if not outright cleansing them. And anything that is ""ethnostate"" is assumed to be a similarly evil thing that is inherently racist and has nazi-esque vibes.",IsraelPalestine,12/03/2024 11:31,1h5k8xu,Twytilus,0,1,0,TRUE,10/03/2020 21:30,183,0,10844,33064,44091,12,"'Settler-Colonial' implies that people moved to the region by choice and displaced the indigenous population. Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence, who prevented holocaust survivors from seeking refuge in the British Mandate.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted. Please research the ways Palestinians are treated in Lebanon and Jordan, where they are banned from certain professions, from owning property, from having full citizenship, all so they can be used as a political tool to put pressure on Israel.

What they do not realise is that the opposite is true. Not only is defeat possible, but in Gaza, they are winning.

For one, countless anaylsts, including those in Israel have commented that Israel has already lost the war. And that it cannot beat Hamas or the Palestinian Joint-Operations Room.

[As early as last month,](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/israel-losing-netanyahu-wont-back-down-his-war-aims) the British defence think tank reported that:

&gt; Israel is not achieving its war aims against Hamas. First, it has only obtained a handful of the hostages. Some have been killed; the fates of many others are still unknown.

Second, Hamas has not been destroyed. Destruction of a terrorist organisation is difficult to measure. Some point to leadership decapitation. However, as Jenna Jordan has pointed out, attriting terrorist leaders seldom brings about their organisations’ collapse. Factors such as popular support, ideology and organisational structure play bigger roles in deciding these groups’ fates. Another measure used to determine if a terrorist group has been destroyed is if its territorial sphere has been reduced or removed. Israel has failed to deprive Hamas of the territory it governed prior to the war. Hamas has been battered in Gaza, but it is still a political force to be reckoned with. Unaffiliated Palestinian clans have refused to join in a post-war reconstruction effort for fear of retaliation by Hamas. Third, Israel has not been able to secure its borders. While it has regained control over some border crossings, the underground infrastructure that has allowed Hamas to engage in smuggling weapons and carrying out attacks is still in place.

[Analdou Agency reported that a former Mossad chief had stated that Israel was unequovically losing the war in Gaza.](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-on-losing-end-in-gaza-war-former-mossad-deputy-chief/3223179). Even Zionist publishers like [JP reported this](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-803955).

[As CNN has reported, Hamas has remained wholly combat effective.](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/08/middleeast/gaza-israel-hamas-battalions-invs-intl/). This is a pattern that staretd early in the war. By December, the IDF was declaring most Hamas batallions to have been dismantled.

This was quickly revealed to be a propaganda lie. As in early 2024, reports emerged that Hamas had begun rehabilitating its batallions in North Gaza. Reports from the Neo-Conservative think tank isw argued that as much as 80% of Hamas' fighting strength was restored. 

According to the isw's report on MArch 27th, they argue that this means Palestinian fighters ""retain  significant degree of combat effectiveness in the area, despite continued Israeli clearing efforts around Gaza City."" and that ""The return of Israeli forces to [Zaytoun] suggests that Palestinian militias continue to operate there similar to how these militias still have a presence in other portions of the northern Gaza Strip.""

We can also check pretty much every battle in Gaza to see how this is true.

The first battle in Gaza was the battle of Beit Hanoun. Despite IDF claims, they never occupied the city. And the battle is considered as having ended in a Palestinian victory. The isw reported that when the IDF left in December, the P-JOR continued effective control over Beit Hanoun. Beit Hanoun was used as a base to attack the IDF and send rockets into Israel, demonstrating that teh IDF had failed to defeat the JOR in Beit Hanoun.

Then we have the First Battle of Jabalia. As the isw reported, Hamas retained control of Jabalia after Israel withdrew in May. 

&gt; ""These points taken together reflect the degree to which Hamas and other Palestinian militias remain combat effective in and around Jabalia. Hamas and the other militias will almost certainly resume their efforts to reconstitute there as the IDF units have left.""

Then we have the Battle of Shuja'iyya. Though the IDF declared victory here, heavy casualties forced them to withdraw and as al-Jazeera reported, Palestinians retained control of the city. Further evidence of Palestinain control is that several months later, the IDF returned to the region to try and wrestle control away from the JOR.

This 2nd battle was just as disastrous for the IDF. After retreating in July, Hamas and the PIJ retained dominance in the city. Again, al-Jazeera reported how this had occured. But not stopping there, when the IDF withdrew in videos from the area one could see Palestinian militants with guns in their hands standing around in broad daylight. Alongside this, government officials working for the P-JOR immediately remerged in the city, as if they had never left, and reasserted doubly Palestinian control in the region.

Then we have the siege of Khan Yunis. The first Israeli assualt ended in abject failure. so great was the routing of the IDF they withdrew from all of southern Gaza. Khan Yunis itself remained under the control of the Joint Operations Room. Again, as reported by the isw. The 2nd and 3rd battles ended in much the same way and in far shorter timespans.

Then comes al-Qarara. By all acounts, a Palestinian victory.The isw reported that Israel was defeated in al-Qarara. They had failed to achieve any of their aims. P-JOR remained in control. No high ranking militants were found or killed, and accordinng to anaylsts, Hamas remained combat effective in the region.

This is how every battle that has ended thus far has gone. Israel went in, killed civilians for a few weeks. Ran into resistance, tried to fight back, upon seeing heavy casualties retreated with Palestine still in control.

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

Yet, despite this significant offer, none of the 101 hostages have been successfully returned so far. What makes this even more perplexing is the clear evidence that some of the hostages are being sheltered and cared for by Gazan civilians. This raises an unsettling question: how could a father, who has the chance to secure safety, a better future for his family, and an improved quality of life, choose instead to keep a hostage? 

This decision defies logic on multiple levels. It is not just about the economic or material benefits offered by Israel. The offer promises a lifeline, an escape from the hardships and dangers that many Gazan civilians face daily. Accepting such an offer would theoretically guarantee safety from ongoing conflicts, access to better healthcare and education, and a future of stability. Yet, the fact that no one has taken advantage of this opportunity suggests a deeper, more troubling dynamic at play.

It leads me to consider whether hatred toward Israelis surpasses the love for their own children among some Gazans. Is the hostility so deeply ingrained that it eclipses even the instinctual drive to protect and provide for their families? This possibility is deeply unsettling, as it speaks to a cycle of animosity that overrides self-preservation and the pursuit of a better life. Such a choice not only perpetuates suffering but also raises important questions about the role of ideology, community pressure, and fear in shaping these decisions.

As far as I am aware, Syria is not directly involved in the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon, but Assad's government is hostile to Israel and one of Hezbollah and Iran's major allies. There is speculation that the rebel attack may have been prompted by the military weakness of Hezbollah and Iran in the wake of conflict with Israel. Syria borders Israel and is only 30 miles from the West Bank at its closest point.

At a minimum, conflict in Syria will further deplete the resources of the Iranian-led alliance and reduce their ability to engage in Lebanon or Gaza. More Hezbollah forces may move into Syria after the ceasefire, or maybe Hezbollah is too depleted to send any more support. In the extreme case Assad may fall and be replaced by another general from within his faction, or by some sort of rebel government. I have no idea what the implications of regime change would be. I don't think it is likely that conflict will spill into Israel directly because the Golan Heights border is well defended, but renewed conflict might change the situation in Lebanon or on Israel's northern border.

This raises an unsettling question: how could a father, who has the chance to secure safety, a better future for his family, and an improved quality of life, choose instead to keep a hostage? 

This decision defies logic on multiple levels. It is not just about the economic or material benefits offered by Israel. The offer promises a lifeline, an escape from the hardships and dangers that many Gazan civilians face daily. Accepting such an offer would theoretically guarantee safety from ongoing conflicts, access to better healthcare and education, and a future of stability. Yet, the fact that no one has taken advantage of this opportunity suggests a deeper, more troubling dynamic at play.

It leads me to consider whether hatred toward Israelis surpasses the love for their own children among some Gazans. Is the hostility so deeply ingrained that it eclipses even the instinctual drive to protect and provide for their families?

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.",It's Barack Obama's fault that the Peace Process collapsed. ,0.41,0,0,12/02/2024 08:35,0,Neutral

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.",It's Barack Obama's fault that the Peace Process collapsed. ,0.41,0,0,12/02/2024 08:35,-1,Pro-Palestine

Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence, who prevented holocaust survivors from seeking refuge in the British Mandate.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted. Please research the ways Palestinians are treated in Lebanon and Jordan, where they are banned from certain professions, from owning property, from having full citizenship, all so they can be used as a political tool to put pressure on Israel.

He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS.

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

It seems fighting is still continuing by Israelis against Hezbollah.   

As far as I know, Israel couldn't negotiate a deal to end hezbollah but instead negotiated a deal to only move hezbollah north of the litani and not allow new weapon supplies, but it did not mention any ideas of disarming hezbollah north of the litani. This was the ceasefire terms agreed upon both sides.   

While it would have been better for Lebanese and for Israelis to have a deal ensuring disarming Hezbollah as a foreign backed militia in Lebanon, this was not the deal Israel was achieved.   

Ever since the ceasefire, Israel has continued attacks on what it claims are hezbollah targets, but they are doing so even north of the Litani river where the deal that both sides agreed to did not mention that hezbollah can't operate there.   

I'm afraid this will do nothing but put anyone who opposes hezbollah from the Lebanese side in a bad position because this would only prove that you can't trust israeli ceasefires and terms. This will only give hezbollah more reasons to remain legitimate and will dismiss any Lebanese efforts to take control.

&gt; An Israeli airstrike on a car in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed five people, including employees of World Central Kitchen. The charity said it was ""urgently seeking more details"" after Israel's military said it targeted a WCK worker who was part of the Hamas attack that sparked the war.

&gt; Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites along Syria's border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said Saturday, testing a fragile, days-old ceasefire that has seen continued sporadic fire.

&gt; The military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria into Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect, which the military said was a violation of its terms. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities or Hezbollah.

Hezbollah smuggling arms is a clear violation of ceasefire terms

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel.

Israelis often feel they're unfairly targeted for their nationality and that you if you're Israeli or shows any Israeli culture literally anywhere, you'll receive harsh criticism, if not outright hatred.



This is absolutely the case. You simply can't even mention Israel at all, or talk about the cutlure of Tel Aviv or Haifa today, without people directly saying that it's all Palestinian land, you're all settlers, etc. It's simply impossible to just share you like Hebrew music or modern Israeli couscous without people bringing up the conflict.


This is especially the case if you're in any context with many people from Middle Eastern, Arab or Muslim people. They aren't known to tolerate people saying they're Israeli.


The same is also true for left-wing activist groups in the West.



It feels really unfair because most other nationalities and ethnicities can simply talk about where they're from without getting an automatic harsh reaction, but they can't. Their very existance is political.



While it's often definitely very related to antisemitism, it's also often motivated by something else, namely, geopolitics and ethnic conflicts.



The thing is, the legitimacy of the State of Israel is not uninamous. Some believe it's not a legitimate state, and it's all an illegal occupation of the sovereign country of Palestine.


You might personally believe it's outrageous and unacceptable, but it's most likely because you grew up in a context where Israel being a state isn't questioned.


But in the Arab World for example most people don't believe Israel is a legitimate state.


But the thing is, the same treatment is often given to people from other disputed or unrecognised regions or states.



For example Abkhazia, it's a partially recognised state in the Caucasus claimed by Georgia as its autonomous region. It declared secession after an ethnic conflict in the 1990s and most of the world doesn't recognise it, except for Russia.


The thing is that the same applies to Abkhazians and any, even apolitical posts about Abkhazia.



If you want to share anything happening in modern day Abkhazia, for example about some caves found there, or about their recent protests there, or their food and culture, people would inevitably bring up Georgia.





And in fact, the vast majority of people will be on the opposing side, and they won't have many people defending them and if not being on their side, at least trying to bring up nuance.


[Ironically, this happens even for people who are themselves citizens of an unrecognised state.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kosovo/comments/1eoar1h/i_want_to_relocate_from_abkhazia_to_kosovo_how_is/)


The problem isn't just that Georgians outnumber Abkhazians (like the Arab World outnumbers Israel) but rather that people that are not directly tied to the conflict will automatically take a side because this will be seen as a proxy for their politics in general. For Abkhazia, the major Western powers (for example the EU) massively support Georgia, and people in the West are against Abkhazia because they believe backing Georgia means being against Russian imperialism.


I've seen it myself, any people who try to bring any nuance to this conflict, even if they're Abkhazian themselves, are accused of being pro Russian. Same with Israel too, in some cases.


Meanwhile, for Israel, left-wing activist circles believe that Israel is a settler colonial state, therefore backing Palestinians at all times is backing decolonization.



Both of these conflicts are actually much more complex than this simplistic narrative, but people don't actually try to learn that, they take sides automatically based on some narrative they've heard.


But because of this politization, merely saying you live in Israel or Abkhazia or are Abkhazian, as opposed to Georgian for example, is seen as itself a political statement.


If you live in Sukhumi and you say you're Abkhazian, even though it's the norm in your society, and saying you're Georgian is as unacceptable as a Georgian saying they're Russian, you're told that if you want to participate in the modern world, you should say you're Georgian and live in Georgia. The same is true for Israelis. If you live in Jaffa, how can you say it's an Israeli city? And use this symbol 🇮🇱 which is very political? For the Palestinians whose family is from there, it can be offensive.


And yes, you can be seen as a settler because the state you live in is seen as illegitimate.


This is very problematic.




All that often also happens with people from other disputed regions or states (Kosovo, South Ossetia, Northern Cyprus, Crimea, Kashmir, Tibet, etc).



Personally, I feel like in both cases, this approach doesn't necessarily help people to actually resolve ethnic conflicts. Instead of actually trying to build ties and create a solution that'll satisfy everyone, for example by strengthening the opposition. For example pro Palestinian people could've supported the Israeli opposition and the Israeli diaspora itself could've been supportive of a Palestinian state and even a right of return. But no, instead, we obsess over the legality of borders and the legitimacy of states, which means people on the opposite side see us as an existential threat to their existance.









We say we're modern people but in reality we're still tribal creatures, unfortunately.


Geopolitics, governments, state sovereignity and independence is unfortunately very ingrained in all of us and it's arguably like modern day religion.



It's sad to fight against this because this doesn't become merely discrimination, but also a geopolitical opinion opposing this state, and it's very hard to draw the lines over what's acceptable and what's not. But often times, people who say that racism is unacceptable still say unacceptable things merely because of the nationality of the person.



**However, unfortunately, this is something that's very common right now and is seen as the natural thing to do. So I've created this post to try to explain the logic of those that oppose anyone automatically if they say they're ""Israelis"", to understand their motivations, to know how to possibly fight against them, and also to oppose similar situations in the Western World, where entire identities become politicised.**



In my opinion, we should really deconstruct the idea of states and nations if we actually want to achieve world peace, or at least strive towards it.


I think we should be much more mindful about how national identities shape our worldview and how people from ""disputed regions"" might still be first and foremost people and we should try to look beyond merely borders and nations, be it recognised or not.




I also believe we shouldn't see the world merely through a lense of ""states"" and ""nations"". I believe the videos and maps about ""X fun thing in every country in the world"" (for example food, music, architecture, fun facts, etc) should also include people without states or with disputed states and that it shouldn't be seen as inherently political. So yeah, including Israel, Palestine, Abkhazia, Tibet, Hawaii, Ingushetia, Tamil Nadu, Jewish diaspora etc. If our world wasn't so fixated on ""countries"", aka, sovereign states, these things would've been much less problematic.

Jews were offered alternative locations: Uganda in Africa, A region in Argentina South America, A faraway location in East Russia (Siberia). None of these locations had anything to do with Jewish ancestry. The connection to the holy land where the ancestors walked was missing.

There's certainly a scriptural basis for the idea of Jews having a *connection* to the land of Israel, but there's nothing I've found in the Jewish tradition/scriture that says Jews need to be in the majority. 

Or maybe something totally different? I know Israel was *planned* as a Jewish state by the UN partition plan, same as Pakistan was planned as a Muslim state..

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things.

Hi everyone! I host a podcast called *Israel &amp; Palestine Unpacked* ([listen here](https://open.spotify.com/show/2o0vVS6BuKrZ21NYxiGsgB)). I’m reaching out to Israelis and Palestinians who are willing to share their personal stories for an upcoming series of episodes. 

The purpose of the podcast is to foster meaningful dialogue and shed light on the human experiences that define life in Israel and Palestine. Through a series of personal stories, we aim to showcase the realities faced by individuals as they navigate their daily lives in this complex region. Each 30-minute episode offers an in-depth exploration of these narratives, featuring interviews with both an Israeli and a Palestinian. Together, they share their perspectives on profound topics such as identity, resilience, and hope, revealing the shared humanity that connects us all.

We’d love to hear your perspective, especially if you’ve experienced the following, but not limited to:

* **Crossing borders and checkpoints**: How does this shape your daily life?
* **Parenting during conflict**: How do you raise children in such challenging environments?
* **Living in mixed or segregated communities**: What are the realities of these spaces?
* **Friendships across divides**: How do you build and maintain connections?
* **Sports**: Can it unite people, or does it create more division?
* **Experiences of conflict**: How has this impacted your perspective?
* **Dreams and aspirations**: What do you hope for your future and your community?
* **Media and misinformation**: How does it shape perceptions and realities in the region?

I know these topics can be deeply personal and emotional, but your story matters. Sharing your perspective can challenge stereotypes, bridge divides, and foster greater empathy among listeners around the world.

If you’re interested or know someone who might be, please send me a private message. Every voice has value, and together, we can create something impactful.

Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence, who prevented holocaust survivors from seeking refuge in the British Mandate.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted. Please research the ways Palestinians are treated in Lebanon and Jordan, where they are banned from certain professions, from owning property, from having full citizenship, all so they can be used as a political tool to put pressure on Israel.

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally .

With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally.

133,m06mvqr,1,"I think it really sinole: there are territories that bdlong to the oalestinians arabs in Palestine: the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza. The first two are under israeli military occupation and taking advantage of this situation, thousands of jewish settlers have expelled Palestinian civilians and stolen land, houses and property protected by the Israeli army, having at their disposal a modern network of exclusive roads, access to water and other benefits to the detriment of the Palestinian population. All this under the banner of building a ""Jewish State"" where minorities like the Palestinians do not have the right to self-determination but are second-class citizens.

That, by any definition, is a ""settler"" project and an ""ethnostate"". 

It's true that there are several “ethostates” in the world, especially in the “first world,” but in the Global South, states are mixed and have several nations within them. From China to India, from Africa to South and Central America. The issue is that Israel “sells” itself as a “democracy” when in reality it oppresses the Palestinians. That is why it is negatively labeled as an Ethnostate despite being composed of a diverse population, and a colonial project because it expands territorially with illegal settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories.",IsraelPalestine,12/03/2024 11:10,1h5k8xu,Agitated_Structure63,0,1,0,TRUE,10/25/2023 19:01,0,0,11,63,74,12,"'Settler-Colonial' implies that people moved to the region by choice and displaced the indigenous population. Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence, who prevented holocaust survivors from seeking refuge in the British Mandate.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted. Please research the ways Palestinians are treated in Lebanon and Jordan, where they are banned from certain professions, from owning property, from having full citizenship, all so they can be used as a political tool to put pressure on Israel.

2819,m00ogho,1,"&gt;It is important to understand the context of why multiple coalition governments have chosen to continue the occupation. It is maintained because it is essential. Not because they hope it will crush rebellion.

Sure, Israel sees it as essential, and there are legitimate reasons to fear that attacks would continue or even get worse if they withdrew from the West Bank. I do understand that. But I think you're wrong in framing the abuses as some sort of outside or unfortunate fringe component at this point. The settlement expansions have been pursued by every successive Israeli government. The current ruling elected government of Israel is directly encouraging and facilitating the solidifying of control of more land through more and more building, for the express purpose of trying to ensure Israel gets to annex more territory in any future peace deal, and they're making a peace deal less likely by doing so. They're also encouraging and facilitating settler violence, as is the IDF itself by refusing to take action to prevent it. 

Similarly, the abusive prison guard you describe isn't an exception at this stage. The extent of torture and abuse in Israeli prisons is absolutely systematic. There wouldn't be enough guards left to watch all of the imprisoned abusive guards if Israel even did try to genuinely deal with this problem and prosecute offenders. The entire system is rancid to the point where the Israeli prison system probably can now fairly be compared to that of Iran. Nor is the forcing of civilians to check buildings for traps an exception - the investigations into it have shown it to be a widespread practice with commanders fully aware of it and choosing not to prevent it, with military leadership tacitly approving it by ignoring it.

Basically, there are legitimate reasons for some of Israel's policies, but Israeli policy - not exceptions, but deliberate and fully understood approaches - are also making the situation actively worse and harder to resolve.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces.

What makes this even more perplexing is the clear evidence that some of the hostages are being sheltered and cared for by Gazan civilians. This raises an unsettling question: how could a father, who has the chance to secure safety, a better future for his family, and an improved quality of life, choose instead to keep a hostage? 

This decision defies logic on multiple levels. It is not just about the economic or material benefits offered by Israel. The offer promises a lifeline, an escape from the hardships and dangers that many Gazan civilians face daily. Accepting such an offer would theoretically guarantee safety from ongoing conflicts, access to better healthcare and education, and a future of stability. Yet, the fact that no one has taken advantage of this opportunity suggests a deeper, more troubling dynamic at play.

It leads me to consider whether hatred toward Israelis surpasses the love for their own children among some Gazans. Is the hostility so deeply ingrained that it eclipses even the instinctual drive to protect and provide for their families? This possibility is deeply unsettling, as it speaks to a cycle of animosity that overrides self-preservation and the pursuit of a better life. Such a choice not only perpetuates suffering but also raises important questions about the role of ideology, community pressure, and fear in shaping these decisions.

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

What they do not realise is that the opposite is true. Not only is defeat possible, but in Gaza, they are winning.

For one, countless anaylsts, including those in Israel have commented that Israel has already lost the war. And that it cannot beat Hamas or the Palestinian Joint-Operations Room.

[As early as last month,](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/israel-losing-netanyahu-wont-back-down-his-war-aims) the British defence think tank reported that:

&gt; Israel is not achieving its war aims against Hamas. First, it has only obtained a handful of the hostages. Some have been killed; the fates of many others are still unknown.

Second, Hamas has not been destroyed. Destruction of a terrorist organisation is difficult to measure. Some point to leadership decapitation. However, as Jenna Jordan has pointed out, attriting terrorist leaders seldom brings about their organisations’ collapse. Factors such as popular support, ideology and organisational structure play bigger roles in deciding these groups’ fates. Another measure used to determine if a terrorist group has been destroyed is if its territorial sphere has been reduced or removed. Israel has failed to deprive Hamas of the territory it governed prior to the war. Hamas has been battered in Gaza, but it is still a political force to be reckoned with. Unaffiliated Palestinian clans have refused to join in a post-war reconstruction effort for fear of retaliation by Hamas. Third, Israel has not been able to secure its borders. While it has regained control over some border crossings, the underground infrastructure that has allowed Hamas to engage in smuggling weapons and carrying out attacks is still in place.

[Analdou Agency reported that a former Mossad chief had stated that Israel was unequovically losing the war in Gaza.](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-on-losing-end-in-gaza-war-former-mossad-deputy-chief/3223179). Even Zionist publishers like [JP reported this](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-803955).

[As CNN has reported, Hamas has remained wholly combat effective.](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/08/middleeast/gaza-israel-hamas-battalions-invs-intl/). This is a pattern that staretd early in the war. By December, the IDF was declaring most Hamas batallions to have been dismantled.

This was quickly revealed to be a propaganda lie. As in early 2024, reports emerged that Hamas had begun rehabilitating its batallions in North Gaza. Reports from the Neo-Conservative think tank isw argued that as much as 80% of Hamas' fighting strength was restored. 

According to the isw's report on MArch 27th, they argue that this means Palestinian fighters ""retain  significant degree of combat effectiveness in the area, despite continued Israeli clearing efforts around Gaza City."" and that ""The return of Israeli forces to [Zaytoun] suggests that Palestinian militias continue to operate there similar to how these militias still have a presence in other portions of the northern Gaza Strip.""

We can also check pretty much every battle in Gaza to see how this is true.

The first battle in Gaza was the battle of Beit Hanoun. Despite IDF claims, they never occupied the city. And the battle is considered as having ended in a Palestinian victory. The isw reported that when the IDF left in December, the P-JOR continued effective control over Beit Hanoun. Beit Hanoun was used as a base to attack the IDF and send rockets into Israel, demonstrating that teh IDF had failed to defeat the JOR in Beit Hanoun.

Then we have the First Battle of Jabalia. As the isw reported, Hamas retained control of Jabalia after Israel withdrew in May. 

&gt; ""These points taken together reflect the degree to which Hamas and other Palestinian militias remain combat effective in and around Jabalia. Hamas and the other militias will almost certainly resume their efforts to reconstitute there as the IDF units have left.""

Then we have the Battle of Shuja'iyya. Though the IDF declared victory here, heavy casualties forced them to withdraw and as al-Jazeera reported, Palestinians retained control of the city. Further evidence of Palestinain control is that several months later, the IDF returned to the region to try and wrestle control away from the JOR.

This 2nd battle was just as disastrous for the IDF. After retreating in July, Hamas and the PIJ retained dominance in the city. Again, al-Jazeera reported how this had occured. But not stopping there, when the IDF withdrew in videos from the area one could see Palestinian militants with guns in their hands standing around in broad daylight. Alongside this, government officials working for the P-JOR immediately remerged in the city, as if they had never left, and reasserted doubly Palestinian control in the region.

Then we have the siege of Khan Yunis. The first Israeli assualt ended in abject failure. so great was the routing of the IDF they withdrew from all of southern Gaza. Khan Yunis itself remained under the control of the Joint Operations Room. Again, as reported by the isw. The 2nd and 3rd battles ended in much the same way and in far shorter timespans.

Then comes al-Qarara. By all acounts, a Palestinian victory.The isw reported that Israel was defeated in al-Qarara. They had failed to achieve any of their aims. P-JOR remained in control. No high ranking militants were found or killed, and accordinng to anaylsts, Hamas remained combat effective in the region.

This is how every battle that has ended thus far has gone. Israel went in, killed civilians for a few weeks. Ran into resistance, tried to fight back, upon seeing heavy casualties retreated with Palestine still in control.

https://x.com/MTVEnglishNews/status/1863159187968045521   

It seems fighting is still continuing by Israelis against Hezbollah.   

As far as I know, Israel couldn't negotiate a deal to end hezbollah but instead negotiated a deal to only move hezbollah north of the litani and not allow new weapon supplies, but it did not mention any ideas of disarming hezbollah north of the litani. This was the ceasefire terms agreed upon both sides.   

While it would have been better for Lebanese and for Israelis to have a deal ensuring disarming Hezbollah as a foreign backed militia in Lebanon, this was not the deal Israel was achieved.   

Ever since the ceasefire, Israel has continued attacks on what it claims are hezbollah targets, but they are doing so even north of the Litani river where the deal that both sides agreed to did not mention that hezbollah can't operate there.   

I'm afraid this will do nothing but put anyone who opposes hezbollah from the Lebanese side in a bad position because this would only prove that you can't trust israeli ceasefires and terms. This will only give hezbollah more reasons to remain legitimate and will dismiss any Lebanese efforts to take control.

&gt; An Israeli airstrike on a car in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed five people, including employees of World Central Kitchen. The charity said it was ""urgently seeking more details"" after Israel's military said it targeted a WCK worker who was part of the Hamas attack that sparked the war.

&gt; Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites along Syria's border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said Saturday, testing a fragile, days-old ceasefire that has seen continued sporadic fire.

&gt; The military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria into Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect, which the military said was a violation of its terms. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities or Hezbollah.

Hezbollah smuggling arms is a clear violation of ceasefire terms

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

I know the general idea was to create a place where Jews would be safe, and I suppose that's the main reason to keep a Jewish majority. 

But are there other reasons?  Maybe some scriptural basis for needing to be majority Jewish?  I can't find any so far.  There's certainly a scriptural basis for the idea of Jews having a *connection* to the land of Israel, but there's nothing I've found in the Jewish tradition/scriture that says Jews need to be in the majority. 

Or maybe something totally different? I know Israel was *planned* as a Jewish state by the UN partition plan, same as Pakistan was planned as a Muslim state.. 

I'm not challenging the idea that it should be majority Jewish. (There's basically no such thing as a state whose native ethnic people has not remained in the majority -- France, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Germany, especially Japan, etc., all remain something like 85%-95% ethnically homogeneous.

I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement? 

And this isn’t the only conflict in the world. It’s not even the largest by people killed or involved. Here is a map that shows all current conflicts. https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things.

That's more or less what they do.  Oddly people get really offended by the word choice even though the word choice is the opposite of what people think:

* Jewish = resident of Judaea (JEWdea) a geographical claim at its core regarding a historical country. 

* Israeli = Isra El   (those who) contend with God a theological claim at its core. 

&gt; what the hell has this got to do with literally anything? Obviously 100% of countries have a history of ethnic conflict. This discussion is about current laws, today, now, that exist in national legislature.

No it is not about today.  It is about the process by which these national transformations happen.  Israel is doing what the Franks long ago did. The Franks are finished, Israel is not.  Centuries from now Israel will be like France, but to get there it needs to have the conflicts France had centuries ago.

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.",It's Barack Obama's fault that the Peace Process collapsed. ,0.41,0,0,12/02/2024 08:35,1,Pro-Israel

2069,m025yu5,1,"&gt; this is based on the actions of IDF and explicit claims made by Bibi's cabinet ministers and other Likud K'nesset members. So this is a question of the quality  of my analysis

You may genuinely think so, but that's not true. Your sources constantly feed you carefully curated information, which form your opinion. If you listened to more objective sources, you'd have known that any attempt to annex any territory, in either Gaza or WB, would pretty much kill any normalization process with moderate Sunni forces in the regions, which is Israel's strategic goal and arguably the only chance for long term survival.

It's actually a lot more likely that Trump would insist on some kind of ceasefire in Gaza (and partial IDF withdrawal) by his inauguration. As to Smotrich, he'll get some promise of new settlements in WB (which will take years to get to any practical stage anyway, taking us on the other side of the next election) and will declare it a victory.

Ben Gvir may throw a tantrum because that's what he loves to do, but he'll either get in line at the end or the system will work around him one way or another. Keep in mind that after Gideon Sa'ar joined the coalition, Netanyahu technically doesn't need Ben Gvir anymore.",IsraelPalestine,12/02/2024 17:00,1h42p22,knign,0,1,0,TRUE,8/26/2019 18:08,281,554,218,45857,46910,1,"My argument is if the former top Israel war cabinet had considered all of Gaza Strip to be part of Israeli land (some call it Greater Israel ), then it would not have flatten much of Gaza. If you think Gaza belongs to you, your property, you would not have flatten much of Gaza. I still think the current top Israeli leadership also doesnt want to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip.

1. Ben-Gurion and early zionists may have commented on Greater Israel. But time has changed, the current top leadership is no Ben-Gurion. Similarly, Trump is no Biden. The government policies will change depending on the leader and changes with the time.

2. Daniella Weiss, Ben-Gvir, Smotrich and other extreme right wings may be salivating at the idea of re-establishing Gush Katif settlements (formerly near Khan Yunis) in the southern Gaza Strip. But none of them were part of the former top Israeli war cabinet, and even currently they do not direct or lead the war. They may try, but this is not official government policy. 

I am trying to explain that is/was not the intention of Israel/IDF to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip. It’s kinda an ancient war maxime (idk what is it called), but you dont destroy the land/ all the buildings if you want to conquer itand considered that land belongs to you.

3. During WW2, Germany didnt destroy Paris. They tried when they were losing and evacuating, but not at the start. They wanted Paris to be intact. And you would too if you are conquering Paris. There is a suggestion (some might dispute it) that the German leader who cannot be named during WW2, did not REALLY wanted to conquer Britain. After defeating France, Germany thought Britain would make peace. There were lots of destruction during the Battle of Britain especially London.

4. US dropped nuclear bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, flatten them. US had no intention of permanently conquering Japan. US never saw Japan as part of US land. US wanted to end the war, and thought using nuclear bomb will do that, and it did, Japan surrendered. US was in Japan for a bit to sort things out then quickly handed over to a transitional Japanese government. US had no intention of conquering Japan.

5. US dropped more than 7.5 million tons of bombs in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. US had no intention of permanently conquering Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos. It’s easier to completely destroy something you dont want/need and even easier if you are not the one going to clean up the mess later down the line. See the pattern….Israel has no intention of funding the rebuilding of Gaza with Israeli money. But that doesnt mean Israel will prevent others from funding the rebuilding of Gaza, mainly from donations from USA, Europe, Arab, Muslim countries and rest of international world but not Israel.

6. I dont have the facts, can someone check how was the six days war fought in Jerusalem ? If my theory is correct, my prediction would be, there should be minimal destruction in Jerusalem. Israel wants/wanted Jerusalem, and to be intact, not flatten. See the difference with Gaza Strip. 

7. What is Jerusalem worth ? Saladdin replied Nothing, then said Everything. I am not saying its historically accurate, i wanted to emphasize how people think. Jerusalem is worth nothing and everything. You wont want to destroy something that valuable. 

8. At the beginning of the Ukraine war, did you noticed the Russia’s attack was very tactical and calculated…lets attack the telecommunication system, military bases, military airbase, railway lines etc… I think at this moment, Putin really thought Ukraine was part of Russia, so he wasnt intending to flatten Ukraine. But Putin’s invasion plans didnt go as plan, F£*&amp; it… then Russia started to change tactic and started to obliterate cities like Bahmut, Mariupol, Kharkiv, etc... Well, if Putin cant have Ukraine, nobody else can…. might as well flatten it. 

9. Even if any US states try to secede from USA, the US military is unlikely going to flatten their cities. Because Washington would have concluded that is part of US land, we shouldnt cause that much destruction. Not to mention the bad press, criticism, protests, etc… the people there are American citizens and they might have family and friends in other parts of the USA. If its not US land, well… I can tell you the approach will be very different.

10. These intentions are not static, and can change. Trump probably has a few ideas of his own and will start making changes next year. Currently, there is rumors that part of Gaza Strip in the north might be turned into a buffer zone by IDF. I think the reason is for security purpose, not for the purpose to annex and not to settle in Gaza.

940,m04jg02,1,"While I can totally agree with you that the Palestinians need to make peace with the idea of acknowledging the right of Israel to exist as a state / homeland for the Jewish people, I disagree with almost everything else you’ve said in your response.

The settlements are not a minor issue the way you claim, they’re a major issue because they indicate more clearly than anything else what Israel’s long-term intentions are with regard to the Palestinian dream of nationhood, which most Israelis presently seem to want to obliterate just as surely as Palestinians themselves have dreamed of obliterating Israeli nationhood.   As I stated in my earlier post, no serious person believes - and I honestly suspect this includes most Israelis themselves - that Israel intends to withdraw via negotiations ten or twenty or thirty years from now from territories where it’s now settled half a million people - the cost and logistics of such a withdrawal let alone the associated public relations optics would be utterly insupportable compared with those of the 9,000-settler 2005 withdrawal from Gaza.   Again, any serious person would assume these are meant to be permanent acquisitions, and that Israel’s goal here, whatever its government’s rhetoric, is indeed a land grab.

And no, the fact that the acreage on which these settlements stand is relatively small means nothing here.   Towns and cities definitionally depend on roads and hinterland to supply them with water, power, trade, defense, and all other economic means of survival, and Israel manifestly has no intention of giving up any of those.   That is precisely why the tens of thousands of Palestinians currently living in area C (61% of the West Bank) are rarely if ever permitted to expand housing (despite “natural population increase”, which is routinely allowed for Jewish settlers to expand theirs) or otherwise utilize 95%+ of the non-urban land for economic purposes, whilst no restrictions of any kind are placed on the settlers.

Moving on, there is in fact presently NO nation anywhere on Earth composed of 165 non-contiguous discrete enclaves as is the case with areas A and B on the West Bank.   And your statement that there are “many nations” nowadays with enclaves / exclaves is in fact very false - there are extremely few modern-day nations of that kind, and in the cases of those that do exist, such as Belgium or Switzerland or Germany or Azerbaijan, the exclaves are generally minute in size compared to the “main body” of the nation in question, generally consisting of a single village or even just a few buildings - Nakhichevan strikes me as the sole sizable exception in that regard, and it’s the SINGLE sizeable exclave of Azerbaijan.  

Looking at maps, that is manifestly not what Israel seems to have in mind for the Palestinian areas of the West Bank.

The “archipelago nation” analogy in the meantime is absurd.   Such nations, if they’re considered to be truly sovereign in their international relations, definitionally control the waterways that separate their islands.   That would obviously not be the case with your envisioned Palestine consisting of dozens if not 165 discontiguous parcels of land separated from each other by territory controlled by the IDF.   Again, no serious person would view Indonesia or the Philippines as truly sovereign independent nations if control of the waterways between their many islands had been ceded to, say, China or the U.S.

You’re a very vigorous and eloquent defender of Israel and a generation or so ago I might have agreed with you that responsibility for the present impasse was more or less entirely due to the Palestinians’ intransigence when Israel offered them reasonable concessions.   But the settlements more than anything else have made it clear to me what Israel’s long-term objective really is, and it really doesn’t seem to be “peaceful co-existence” alongside an independent Palestinian homeland anymore.  The goal has become to pen the Palestinians into small, nonviable, discontiguous fragments of land where they can be easily controlled and perhaps eventually given some sort of symbolic window dressing of political autonomy, in an effort to fool the rest of us in foreign countries into believing that their dream of a truly free and prosperous independent future has been fulfilled.

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

So let's have the British fist repay Palestinians for denying them self-determination for 26 years and for their awful, undemocratic transition plan. Then we can have Zionist organizations repay Palestinians for their support of the Mandate. Then we can have Israel repay Palestinians for their ethnic cleansing, land theft, and resulting costs.

After that sure, lets have the newly established Palestinian state create a fund aimed to support descendants of victims of WW2 proportional to Palestinian influence on that war. That seems like a great thing to do.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement? 

And this isn’t the only conflict in the world. It’s not even the largest by people killed or involved. Here is a map that shows all current conflicts. https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker

It seems fighting is still continuing by Israelis against Hezbollah.   

As far as I know, Israel couldn't negotiate a deal to end hezbollah but instead negotiated a deal to only move hezbollah north of the litani and not allow new weapon supplies, but it did not mention any ideas of disarming hezbollah north of the litani. This was the ceasefire terms agreed upon both sides.   

While it would have been better for Lebanese and for Israelis to have a deal ensuring disarming Hezbollah as a foreign backed militia in Lebanon, this was not the deal Israel was achieved.   

Ever since the ceasefire, Israel has continued attacks on what it claims are hezbollah targets, but they are doing so even north of the Litani river where the deal that both sides agreed to did not mention that hezbollah can't operate there.   

I'm afraid this will do nothing but put anyone who opposes hezbollah from the Lebanese side in a bad position because this would only prove that you can't trust israeli ceasefires and terms. This will only give hezbollah more reasons to remain legitimate and will dismiss any Lebanese efforts to take control.     
   
   
EDIT: From one of the replies:

[link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/israel-hezbollah-syria-ceasefire-gaza-world-central-kitchen/)

&gt; An Israeli airstrike on a car in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed five people, including employees of World Central Kitchen. The charity said it was ""urgently seeking more details"" after Israel's military said it targeted a WCK worker who was part of the Hamas attack that sparked the war.

&gt; Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites along Syria's border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said Saturday, testing a fragile, days-old ceasefire that has seen continued sporadic fire.

&gt; The military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria into Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect, which the military said was a violation of its terms. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities or Hezbollah.

Hezbollah smuggling arms is a clear violation of ceasefire terms

Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence, who prevented holocaust survivors from seeking refuge in the British Mandate.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted. Please research the ways Palestinians are treated in Lebanon and Jordan, where they are banned from certain professions, from owning property, from having full citizenship, all so they can be used as a political tool to put pressure on Israel.

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.",It's Barack Obama's fault that the Peace Process collapsed. ,0.41,0,0,12/02/2024 08:35,0,Neutral

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces.

2757,m00r3zp,2,"&gt; The first battle in Gaza was the battle of Beit Hanoun. Despite IDF claims, they never occupied the city.

That’s the IDF‘s strategy. They will go into and area, kill all fighters they can find and destroy military infrastructure like tunnels. Once they can’t find any anymore, they leave. Hamas fighters hide or flee.  

Once Hamas has reorganized and gained strength again in the area, the IDF goes back in again for another round. 

That has been pretty successful so far. 

Claiming a Hamas victory because they are still around is stretch. Their tunnel infrastructure and good preparation for this war has enabled them to be effective for a long time. However their capabilities shrink more and more. Hamas‘ drone and rocket attacks become more and more rare. They lose fighters constantly.

Wars rarely end with total eradication of the enemy.

What they do not realise is that the opposite is true. Not only is defeat possible, but in Gaza, they are winning.

For one, countless anaylsts, including those in Israel have commented that Israel has already lost the war. And that it cannot beat Hamas or the Palestinian Joint-Operations Room.

[As early as last month,](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/israel-losing-netanyahu-wont-back-down-his-war-aims) the British defence think tank reported that:

&gt; Israel is not achieving its war aims against Hamas. First, it has only obtained a handful of the hostages. Some have been killed; the fates of many others are still unknown.

Second, Hamas has not been destroyed. Destruction of a terrorist organisation is difficult to measure. Some point to leadership decapitation. However, as Jenna Jordan has pointed out, attriting terrorist leaders seldom brings about their organisations’ collapse. Factors such as popular support, ideology and organisational structure play bigger roles in deciding these groups’ fates. Another measure used to determine if a terrorist group has been destroyed is if its territorial sphere has been reduced or removed. Israel has failed to deprive Hamas of the territory it governed prior to the war. Hamas has been battered in Gaza, but it is still a political force to be reckoned with. Unaffiliated Palestinian clans have refused to join in a post-war reconstruction effort for fear of retaliation by Hamas. Third, Israel has not been able to secure its borders. While it has regained control over some border crossings, the underground infrastructure that has allowed Hamas to engage in smuggling weapons and carrying out attacks is still in place.

[Analdou Agency reported that a former Mossad chief had stated that Israel was unequovically losing the war in Gaza.](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-on-losing-end-in-gaza-war-former-mossad-deputy-chief/3223179). Even Zionist publishers like [JP reported this](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-803955).

[As CNN has reported, Hamas has remained wholly combat effective.](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/08/middleeast/gaza-israel-hamas-battalions-invs-intl/). This is a pattern that staretd early in the war. By December, the IDF was declaring most Hamas batallions to have been dismantled.

This was quickly revealed to be a propaganda lie. As in early 2024, reports emerged that Hamas had begun rehabilitating its batallions in North Gaza. Reports from the Neo-Conservative think tank isw argued that as much as 80% of Hamas' fighting strength was restored. 

According to the isw's report on MArch 27th, they argue that this means Palestinian fighters ""retain  significant degree of combat effectiveness in the area, despite continued Israeli clearing efforts around Gaza City."" and that ""The return of Israeli forces to [Zaytoun] suggests that Palestinian militias continue to operate there similar to how these militias still have a presence in other portions of the northern Gaza Strip.""

We can also check pretty much every battle in Gaza to see how this is true.

The first battle in Gaza was the battle of Beit Hanoun. Despite IDF claims, they never occupied the city. And the battle is considered as having ended in a Palestinian victory. The isw reported that when the IDF left in December, the P-JOR continued effective control over Beit Hanoun. Beit Hanoun was used as a base to attack the IDF and send rockets into Israel, demonstrating that teh IDF had failed to defeat the JOR in Beit Hanoun.

Then we have the First Battle of Jabalia. As the isw reported, Hamas retained control of Jabalia after Israel withdrew in May. 

&gt; ""These points taken together reflect the degree to which Hamas and other Palestinian militias remain combat effective in and around Jabalia. Hamas and the other militias will almost certainly resume their efforts to reconstitute there as the IDF units have left.""

Then we have the Battle of Shuja'iyya. Though the IDF declared victory here, heavy casualties forced them to withdraw and as al-Jazeera reported, Palestinians retained control of the city. Further evidence of Palestinain control is that several months later, the IDF returned to the region to try and wrestle control away from the JOR.

This 2nd battle was just as disastrous for the IDF. After retreating in July, Hamas and the PIJ retained dominance in the city. Again, al-Jazeera reported how this had occured. But not stopping there, when the IDF withdrew in videos from the area one could see Palestinian militants with guns in their hands standing around in broad daylight. Alongside this, government officials working for the P-JOR immediately remerged in the city, as if they had never left, and reasserted doubly Palestinian control in the region.

Then we have the siege of Khan Yunis. The first Israeli assualt ended in abject failure. so great was the routing of the IDF they withdrew from all of southern Gaza. Khan Yunis itself remained under the control of the Joint Operations Room. Again, as reported by the isw. The 2nd and 3rd battles ended in much the same way and in far shorter timespans.

Then comes al-Qarara. By all acounts, a Palestinian victory.The isw reported that Israel was defeated in al-Qarara. They had failed to achieve any of their aims. P-JOR remained in control. No high ranking militants were found or killed, and accordinng to anaylsts, Hamas remained combat effective in the region.

This is how every battle that has ended thus far has gone. Israel went in, killed civilians for a few weeks. Ran into resistance, tried to fight back, upon seeing heavy casualties retreated with Palestine still in control.

644,m05dm1r,1,"Anti Zionism is not the same as antisemitism. If you’re antisemitic, you’re a bigot. If your anti Zionist, you believe the people of Palestine are entitled to live and worship in their ancestral land without the oppression and thievery and murder  by a genocidal regime that showed up less than a century ago. 

Zionism is fundamentally flawed because it prioritizes the creation of a Jewish state over the rights of the indigenous Palestinian population, resulting in the theft of their land and resources. The establishment of Israel in 1948 was marked by the forced displacement of over 700,000 Palestinians during the Nakba where entire villages were destroyed, and Palestinians were stripped of their homes, heritage, and livelihoods. This dispossession continues today through the expansion of settlements, land confiscations, and discriminatory policies that further erode Palestinian sovereignty. Critics argue that Zionism institutionalizes these injustices by privileging one group’s national aspirations over the rights of another group that has lived on the land for centuries. Anti-Zionism, therefore, is a rejection of the colonial framework that justifies the erasure of indigenous people and their history.
   
Supporting Jewish people’s right to practice their religion does not require endorsing a political ideology rooted in the theft of indigenous land. Zionism’s reliance on displacement and systemic inequality makes it incompatible with principles of justice, human rights, and coexistence. Anti-Zionism challenges this framework, advocating instead for a future where all people in the region—Jews, Palestinians, and others—can live with equal rights, dignity, and sovereignty.

I know the general idea was to create a place where Jews would be safe, and I suppose that's the main reason to keep a Jewish majority. 

But are there other reasons?  Maybe some scriptural basis for needing to be majority Jewish?  I can't find any so far.  There's certainly a scriptural basis for the idea of Jews having a *connection* to the land of Israel, but there's nothing I've found in the Jewish tradition/scriture that says Jews need to be in the majority. 

Or maybe something totally different? I know Israel was *planned* as a Jewish state by the UN partition plan, same as Pakistan was planned as a Muslim state.. 

I'm not challenging the idea that it should be majority Jewish. (There's basically no such thing as a state whose native ethnic people has not remained in the majority -- France, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Germany, especially Japan, etc., all remain something like 85%-95% ethnically homogeneous.  So I don't see anything strange about Jews being the majority in Israel.) 

So I'm not asking ""why"" as a way to criticize Israel.  I'm searching for all the possible reasons why any stakeholders want to keep it majority Jewish.

It seems fighting is still continuing by Israelis against Hezbollah.   

As far as I know, Israel couldn't negotiate a deal to end hezbollah but instead negotiated a deal to only move hezbollah north of the litani and not allow new weapon supplies, but it did not mention any ideas of disarming hezbollah north of the litani. This was the ceasefire terms agreed upon both sides.   

While it would have been better for Lebanese and for Israelis to have a deal ensuring disarming Hezbollah as a foreign backed militia in Lebanon, this was not the deal Israel was achieved.   

Ever since the ceasefire, Israel has continued attacks on what it claims are hezbollah targets, but they are doing so even north of the Litani river where the deal that both sides agreed to did not mention that hezbollah can't operate there.   

I'm afraid this will do nothing but put anyone who opposes hezbollah from the Lebanese side in a bad position because this would only prove that you can't trust israeli ceasefires and terms. This will only give hezbollah more reasons to remain legitimate and will dismiss any Lebanese efforts to take control.

[link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/israel-hezbollah-syria-ceasefire-gaza-world-central-kitchen/)

&gt; An Israeli airstrike on a car in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed five people, including employees of World Central Kitchen. The charity said it was ""urgently seeking more details"" after Israel's military said it targeted a WCK worker who was part of the Hamas attack that sparked the war.

&gt; Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites along Syria's border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said Saturday, testing a fragile, days-old ceasefire that has seen continued sporadic fire.

&gt; The military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria into Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect, which the military said was a violation of its terms. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities or Hezbollah.

Hezbollah smuggling arms is a clear violation of ceasefire terms

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.",It's Barack Obama's fault that the Peace Process collapsed. ,0.41,0,0,12/02/2024 08:35,0,Neutral

Notice how this definition has to specify who the self-determination is for? This is because Zionism was a movement which said that Jews should get to decide how they form their own state. Going by the 1947 partition, in forming their own state however, the land which they took had many hundreds of thousands Arabs living on it. \*These Arabs were not given self determination\* to decide how/whether a state should be formed. The ensuing state would have also divided family and friends from one another and formed strange geographic boundaries, among other issues. Again, Zionism did not give Arabs any say in this process, and thus denied them of self determination.",IsraelPalestine,12/02/2024 23:28,1h4mvic,Playful_Yogurt_9903,0,1,0,TRUE,08/10/2024 02:11,0,0,18,51,69,59,"I grew up for 40 years thinking mass antisemitism was a thing of the past.

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

3164,m004g5p,-12,"Well said. This is basically it in a nutshell. And I agree that any logical person who is not blindly following zionism would see how this is just a nasty thing to happen to anyone. 

Zionism isn't possible without the displacement of nearly a million people from their homes. Now fast forward to today and ask urself if Israel would allow a tiny population to do that to them? To have them displace half their population, have over half of their country GIVEN to someone else again ur will, and then on top of that, to gove this new population all the control over power and water, and then give them weapons and money and all the support in the world so you cannot so anything to claim what was once urs, back. In the meantime, you have lost ur home and possessions, forced to start ur life all over again and most likely from a tent... im sure the zionists wouldn't like that and I'm sure they wouldn't stop wanting their homes back. To then add insult to injury, this new group now starts to expand upon their ""agreed"" boarders every year by nutty settlers who comes and steals your home and has military backing them in he process to make sure there's nothing u can do about it. U try to complain... but to who!? Noones listening... instead they say ok we will look in to it, and continute to supply ur enemy with more weapons and more money, sending them the message to ultimately keep doing what they're doing. 

I've not even mentioned the apartheid state nor rge oppression.... thats all to follow! But for now just the very basics of zionism has already done the damage. The fact that Israel ""must exist"" is one thing (which i don't agree with.. as no country or state imo has an inherent right to exist), but then to say it must exist in a very specific geo location at whatever expense is just madness. Especially when ut was already inhabited. 

Why didn't Germany just give some of its land to them after the holocaust? Wouldn't that have been the fairest thing to do? But no... it had to be taken from Palestinians. That's wrong! Very wrong! That's why I'm against zionism.

I’m not getting why,if not for antisemitism, are people are so anti-Zionist and why this conflict is so focussed on. I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

Why is the focus on Ukraine minimal when it is one if the most despicable wars ever with the potential of the collapse of Western society? 

People deny this is rooted in antisemitism and I want to believe they’re accurate, but in our community, we just can’t come up with any other reason! So if you are Anti-Zionist, what do you think Zionism is? Do we not have the right to self define? Is the definition offensive to you?

https://x.com/MTVEnglishNews/status/1863159187968045521   

It seems fighting is still continuing by Israelis against Hezbollah.   

As far as I know, Israel couldn't negotiate a deal to end hezbollah but instead negotiated a deal to only move hezbollah north of the litani and not allow new weapon supplies, but it did not mention any ideas of disarming hezbollah north of the litani. This was the ceasefire terms agreed upon both sides.   

While it would have been better for Lebanese and for Israelis to have a deal ensuring disarming Hezbollah as a foreign backed militia in Lebanon, this was not the deal Israel was achieved.   

Ever since the ceasefire, Israel has continued attacks on what it claims are hezbollah targets, but they are doing so even north of the Litani river where the deal that both sides agreed to did not mention that hezbollah can't operate there.   

I'm afraid this will do nothing but put anyone who opposes hezbollah from the Lebanese side in a bad position because this would only prove that you can't trust israeli ceasefires and terms. This will only give hezbollah more reasons to remain legitimate and will dismiss any Lebanese efforts to take control.     
   
   
EDIT: From one of the replies:

[link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/israel-hezbollah-syria-ceasefire-gaza-world-central-kitchen/)

&gt; An Israeli airstrike on a car in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed five people, including employees of World Central Kitchen. The charity said it was ""urgently seeking more details"" after Israel's military said it targeted a WCK worker who was part of the Hamas attack that sparked the war.

&gt; Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites along Syria's border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said Saturday, testing a fragile, days-old ceasefire that has seen continued sporadic fire.

&gt; The military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria into Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect, which the military said was a violation of its terms. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities or Hezbollah.

Hezbollah smuggling arms is a clear violation of ceasefire terms

However, that does not explain why Israel has bombed a member of the Lebanese Army in the far north. They're also destroying random buildings in the south, that was not part of any agreement.

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally.

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.",It's Barack Obama's fault that the Peace Process collapsed. ,0.41,0,0,12/02/2024 08:35,0,Neutral

One is what 'Zionism' actually means, as an ideology. Your definition is pretty close to standard although it inserts some unnecessary asides. There are legitimate reasons to consider it problematic (since it involved either displacing or acquiring sovereignty over the existing population, and mass migration without their consent), but we can skip over those.

The second is what people use it to signify when they apply it as a label to themselves. When someone in 2024 says they are a 'proud Zionist', they don't mean they support the historical foundation of the State of Israel in the 1940s.

I'm sure they do! But they are instead using it as a shibboleth or a kind of virtue-signalling, to signify that they are part of a group that considers criticism of Israel unacceptable and will go out of its way to justify Israel's actions.

Some use it to signify that they are in favour of expansionism and a 'greater Israel' (and they view this as simply the realisation of the original Zionist goal).

If you think Gaza belongs to you, your property, you would not have flatten much of Gaza. I still think the current top Israeli leadership also doesnt want to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip.

1. Ben-Gurion and early zionists may have commented on Greater Israel. But time has changed, the current top leadership is no Ben-Gurion. Similarly, Trump is no Biden. The government policies will change depending on the leader and changes with the time.

2. Daniella Weiss, Ben-Gvir, Smotrich and other extreme right wings may be salivating at the idea of re-establishing Gush Katif settlements (formerly near Khan Yunis) in the southern Gaza Strip. But none of them were part of the former top Israeli war cabinet, and even currently they do not direct or lead the war. They may try, but this is not official government policy. 

I am trying to explain that is/was not the intention of Israel/IDF to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip. It’s kinda an ancient war maxime (idk what is it called), but you dont destroy the land/ all the buildings if you want to conquer itand considered that land belongs to you.

3. During WW2, Germany didnt destroy Paris. They tried when they were losing and evacuating, but not at the start. They wanted Paris to be intact. And you would too if you are conquering Paris. There is a suggestion (some might dispute it) that the German leader who cannot be named during WW2, did not REALLY wanted to conquer Britain. After defeating France, Germany thought Britain would make peace. There were lots of destruction during the Battle of Britain especially London.

4. US dropped nuclear bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, flatten them. US had no intention of permanently conquering Japan. US never saw Japan as part of US land. US wanted to end the war, and thought using nuclear bomb will do that, and it did, Japan surrendered. US was in Japan for a bit to sort things out then quickly handed over to a transitional Japanese government. US had no intention of conquering Japan.

5. US dropped more than 7.5 million tons of bombs in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. US had no intention of permanently conquering Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos. It’s easier to completely destroy something you dont want/need and even easier if you are not the one going to clean up the mess later down the line. See the pattern….Israel has no intention of funding the rebuilding of Gaza with Israeli money. But that doesnt mean Israel will prevent others from funding the rebuilding of Gaza, mainly from donations from USA, Europe, Arab, Muslim countries and rest of international world but not Israel.

6. I dont have the facts, can someone check how was the six days war fought in Jerusalem ? If my theory is correct, my prediction would be, there should be minimal destruction in Jerusalem. Israel wants/wanted Jerusalem, and to be intact, not flatten. See the difference with Gaza Strip. 

7. What is Jerusalem worth ? Saladdin replied Nothing, then said Everything. I am not saying its historically accurate, i wanted to emphasize how people think. Jerusalem is worth nothing and everything. You wont want to destroy something that valuable. 

8. At the beginning of the Ukraine war, did you noticed the Russia’s attack was very tactical and calculated…lets attack the telecommunication system, military bases, military airbase, railway lines etc… I think at this moment, Putin really thought Ukraine was part of Russia, so he wasnt intending to flatten Ukraine. But Putin’s invasion plans didnt go as plan, F£*&amp; it… then Russia started to change tactic and started to obliterate cities like Bahmut, Mariupol, Kharkiv, etc... Well, if Putin cant have Ukraine, nobody else can…. might as well flatten it. 

9. Even if any US states try to secede from USA, the US military is unlikely going to flatten their cities. Because Washington would have concluded that is part of US land, we shouldnt cause that much destruction. Not to mention the bad press, criticism, protests, etc… the people there are American citizens and they might have family and friends in other parts of the USA. If its not US land, well… I can tell you the approach will be very different.

10. These intentions are not static, and can change. Trump probably has a few ideas of his own and will start making changes next year. Currently, there is rumors that part of Gaza Strip in the north might be turned into a buffer zone by IDF. I think the reason is for security purpose, not for the purpose to annex and not to settle in Gaza.

138,m06mmqu,1,"So I have addressed many of these talking points before but I will give a break down of each. 

1)Fleeing persecution and colonizing an area are not mutually exclusive things. The Puritans who came to America as part of a settler colonial enterprise were fleeing religious persecution in England. It was still colonialism. Among some of the Spanish settlers in the Americas you had not just conquistadors and missionaries, but also conversos and some members of the Sephardic Jewish community fleeing the persecution of the Spanish Inquisition. They were still settlers when they came to the New World as part of a colonial enterprise. 

2)As of now the notion that Muslims have equal rights in Israel is something that is questionable. Itamar Ben Gavir literally instructed Israeli police to prevent Mosques from being able to engage in the call to prayer which is a central part of Islamic religious practice. 

3)The notion that displacement only took place when a ""genocidal war"" was waged on Israel is a myth that Israeli nationalists and the Pro Israel movement repeats to itself. It's premised on the notion that the Arab armies attacked, they got defeated, and that is why Palestinians are refugees. Except it gets the history exactly backwards. In 47 and 48 the wars that took place happened in two crucial stages. The first is the Palestine civil war of 47. The second is the wider Arab Israeli war of 48. It was during the Palestine civil war between Palestinian Arabs and members of the Zionist militia groups that refugees emerged. And they emerged primarily due to events such as the Deir Yassin massacre as well as the forcible displacement of Palestinians from villages and towns as part of operations such as Plan D which formulated all the way back in the 30s. It was in reaction to the influx of Palestinian refugees into their countries that the Arab nations then attacked Israel, especially after the Deir Yassin massacre. Because both the massacres as well as the presence of refugees inflamed Arab public opinion at the time. So it is simply false to claim that the Arab attack in 48 caused the refugee problem. The refugee problem was one of the catalysts for the Arab attack. 

4)I would agree that using the term ""white supremacy"" in the context of the Israel Palestine conflict is not helpful. Settler colonial however can still be appropriate. Settler colonial systems can utilized white supremacy, but they are not bound by white supremacy or any particular racial group. For example in Afghanistan during its history the Pashtun population engaged in their own form of settler colonialism of the Northern part of the country.  But ""white supremacy"" wasn't the motivating factor there. Indonesia is engaged in a settler colonial project right now in West Papua which one of the longest running occupations going on since 1962. So ""white supremacy"" isn't the right terminology here. Settler colonialism, along with racism and Orientalism would be better fits. 

5)Colonialism comes in different forms. You don't have to be a colony of another nation to be engaging in a particular form of colonialism. Colonialism that is tied to Imperialism requires those things. Settler colonialism as well as other forms such as internal colonialism do not. Just like ideologies such as Capitalism, Communism, Liberalism, etc there are different expressions of Colonialism. The notion that colonialism has to be tied down to one expression is false.",IsraelPalestine,12/03/2024 11:07,1h5k8xu,Anglicanpolitics123,0,1,0,TRUE,9/27/2019 6:53,8526,0,53539,34125,96190,12,"'Settler-Colonial' implies that people moved to the region by choice and displaced the indigenous population. Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence, who prevented holocaust survivors from seeking refuge in the British Mandate.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted. Please research the ways Palestinians are treated in Lebanon and Jordan, where they are banned from certain professions, from owning property, from having full citizenship, all so they can be used as a political tool to put pressure on Israel.

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it?

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive.

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things.

It seems fighting is still continuing by Israelis against Hezbollah.   

As far as I know, Israel couldn't negotiate a deal to end hezbollah but instead negotiated a deal to only move hezbollah north of the litani and not allow new weapon supplies, but it did not mention any ideas of disarming hezbollah north of the litani. This was the ceasefire terms agreed upon both sides.   

While it would have been better for Lebanese and for Israelis to have a deal ensuring disarming Hezbollah as a foreign backed militia in Lebanon, this was not the deal Israel was achieved.   

Ever since the ceasefire, Israel has continued attacks on what it claims are hezbollah targets, but they are doing so even north of the Litani river where the deal that both sides agreed to did not mention that hezbollah can't operate there.   

I'm afraid this will do nothing but put anyone who opposes hezbollah from the Lebanese side in a bad position because this would only prove that you can't trust israeli ceasefires and terms. This will only give hezbollah more reasons to remain legitimate and will dismiss any Lebanese efforts to take control.

&gt; An Israeli airstrike on a car in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed five people, including employees of World Central Kitchen. The charity said it was ""urgently seeking more details"" after Israel's military said it targeted a WCK worker who was part of the Hamas attack that sparked the war.

&gt; Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites along Syria's border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said Saturday, testing a fragile, days-old ceasefire that has seen continued sporadic fire.

&gt; The military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria into Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect, which the military said was a violation of its terms. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities or Hezbollah.

Hezbollah smuggling arms is a clear violation of ceasefire terms

---

However, that does not explain why Israel has bombed a member of the Lebanese Army in the far north. They're also destroying random buildings in the south, that was not part of any agreement.     

Both france and the US are blaming Israel for violating the ceasefire",What do you think about the continued attacks in Lebanon after the ceasefire?,0.71,31,0,12/01/2024 11:24,1,Pro-Israel

However, Jews are not one piece. One faction is now becoming very powerful, and extremely influential in American politics: The more Conservative, Pro-Netanyahu, Florida Jews are Netanyahu's strongest power base among the American Jewish community and they are also becoming more and more powerful in the Political scene.

The Falic family, a very powerful family in the Florida Jewish community, is the biggest donor to Netanyahu, and he basically lives at their expense. They are also very right-wing. The Falics are Billionaires. They donated a lot of money to Republicans such as Ted Cruz, Ron DeSantis, and Marco Rubio and also sponsored some trips to the West Bank of Mike Pompeo and Mike Huckabee.

Former Democrat Bill Ackman, a classic Liberal jew on Paper, also left the Democrats due to their treatment of Netanyahu and started to donate to Trump.

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.",It's Barack Obama's fault that the Peace Process collapsed. ,0.41,0,0,12/02/2024 08:35,0,Neutral

Israelis often feel they're unfairly targeted for their nationality and that you if you're Israeli or shows any Israeli culture literally anywhere, you'll receive harsh criticism, if not outright hatred.



This is absolutely the case. You simply can't even mention Israel at all, or talk about the cutlure of Tel Aviv or Haifa today, without people directly saying that it's all Palestinian land, you're all settlers, etc. It's simply impossible to just share you like Hebrew music or modern Israeli couscous without people bringing up the conflict.


This is especially the case if you're in any context with many people from Middle Eastern, Arab or Muslim people. They aren't known to tolerate people saying they're Israeli.


The same is also true for left-wing activist groups in the West.



It feels really unfair because most other nationalities and ethnicities can simply talk about where they're from without getting an automatic harsh reaction, but they can't. Their very existance is political.



While it's often definitely very related to antisemitism, it's also often motivated by something else, namely, geopolitics and ethnic conflicts.



The thing is, the legitimacy of the State of Israel is not uninamous. Some believe it's not a legitimate state, and it's all an illegal occupation of the sovereign country of Palestine.


You might personally believe it's outrageous and unacceptable, but it's most likely because you grew up in a context where Israel being a state isn't questioned.


But in the Arab World for example most people don't believe Israel is a legitimate state.


But the thing is, the same treatment is often given to people from other disputed or unrecognised regions or states.



For example Abkhazia, it's a partially recognised state in the Caucasus claimed by Georgia as its autonomous region. It declared secession after an ethnic conflict in the 1990s and most of the world doesn't recognise it, except for Russia.


The thing is that the same applies to Abkhazians and any, even apolitical posts about Abkhazia.



If you want to share anything happening in modern day Abkhazia, for example about some caves found there, or about their recent protests there, or their food and culture, people would inevitably bring up Georgia.





And in fact, the vast majority of people will be on the opposing side, and they won't have many people defending them and if not being on their side, at least trying to bring up nuance.


[Ironically, this happens even for people who are themselves citizens of an unrecognised state.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kosovo/comments/1eoar1h/i_want_to_relocate_from_abkhazia_to_kosovo_how_is/)


The problem isn't just that Georgians outnumber Abkhazians (like the Arab World outnumbers Israel) but rather that people that are not directly tied to the conflict will automatically take a side because this will be seen as a proxy for their politics in general. For Abkhazia, the major Western powers (for example the EU) massively support Georgia, and people in the West are against Abkhazia because they believe backing Georgia means being against Russian imperialism.


I've seen it myself, any people who try to bring any nuance to this conflict, even if they're Abkhazian themselves, are accused of being pro Russian. Same with Israel too, in some cases.


Meanwhile, for Israel, left-wing activist circles believe that Israel is a settler colonial state, therefore backing Palestinians at all times is backing decolonization.



Both of these conflicts are actually much more complex than this simplistic narrative, but people don't actually try to learn that, they take sides automatically based on some narrative they've heard.


But because of this politization, merely saying you live in Israel or Abkhazia or are Abkhazian, as opposed to Georgian for example, is seen as itself a political statement.


If you live in Sukhumi and you say you're Abkhazian, even though it's the norm in your society, and saying you're Georgian is as unacceptable as a Georgian saying they're Russian, you're told that if you want to participate in the modern world, you should say you're Georgian and live in Georgia. The same is true for Israelis. If you live in Jaffa, how can you say it's an Israeli city? And use this symbol 🇮🇱 which is very political? For the Palestinians whose family is from there, it can be offensive.


And yes, you can be seen as a settler because the state you live in is seen as illegitimate.


This is very problematic.




All that often also happens with people from other disputed regions or states (Kosovo, South Ossetia, Northern Cyprus, Crimea, Kashmir, Tibet, etc).



Personally, I feel like in both cases, this approach doesn't necessarily help people to actually resolve ethnic conflicts. Instead of actually trying to build ties and create a solution that'll satisfy everyone, for example by strengthening the opposition. For example pro Palestinian people could've supported the Israeli opposition and the Israeli diaspora itself could've been supportive of a Palestinian state and even a right of return. But no, instead, we obsess over the legality of borders and the legitimacy of states, which means people on the opposite side see us as an existential threat to their existance.









We say we're modern people but in reality we're still tribal creatures, unfortunately.


Geopolitics, governments, state sovereignity and independence is unfortunately very ingrained in all of us and it's arguably like modern day religion.



It's sad to fight against this because this doesn't become merely discrimination, but also a geopolitical opinion opposing this state, and it's very hard to draw the lines over what's acceptable and what's not. But often times, people who say that racism is unacceptable still say unacceptable things merely because of the nationality of the person.



**However, unfortunately, this is something that's very common right now and is seen as the natural thing to do. So I've created this post to try to explain the logic of those that oppose anyone automatically if they say they're ""Israelis"", to understand their motivations, to know how to possibly fight against them, and also to oppose similar situations in the Western World, where entire identities become politicised.**



In my opinion, we should really deconstruct the idea of states and nations if we actually want to achieve world peace, or at least strive towards it.


I think we should be much more mindful about how national identities shape our worldview and how people from ""disputed regions"" might still be first and foremost people and we should try to look beyond merely borders and nations, be it recognised or not.




I also believe we shouldn't see the world merely through a lense of ""states"" and ""nations"". I believe the videos and maps about ""X fun thing in every country in the world"" (for example food, music, architecture, fun facts, etc) should also include people without states or with disputed states and that it shouldn't be seen as inherently political. So yeah, including Israel, Palestine, Abkhazia, Tibet, Hawaii, Ingushetia, Tamil Nadu, Jewish diaspora etc. If our world wasn't so fixated on ""countries"", aka, sovereign states, these things would've been much less problematic.

My wife is Serbian and we watched Serbia get Kosovo taken away in 1999. Very painful to this day. They lost it and that's it.

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

What they do not realise is that the opposite is true. Not only is defeat possible, but in Gaza, they are winning.

For one, countless anaylsts, including those in Israel have commented that Israel has already lost the war. And that it cannot beat Hamas or the Palestinian Joint-Operations Room.

[As early as last month,](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/israel-losing-netanyahu-wont-back-down-his-war-aims) the British defence think tank reported that:

&gt; Israel is not achieving its war aims against Hamas. First, it has only obtained a handful of the hostages. Some have been killed; the fates of many others are still unknown.

Second, Hamas has not been destroyed. Destruction of a terrorist organisation is difficult to measure. Some point to leadership decapitation. However, as Jenna Jordan has pointed out, attriting terrorist leaders seldom brings about their organisations’ collapse. Factors such as popular support, ideology and organisational structure play bigger roles in deciding these groups’ fates. Another measure used to determine if a terrorist group has been destroyed is if its territorial sphere has been reduced or removed. Israel has failed to deprive Hamas of the territory it governed prior to the war. Hamas has been battered in Gaza, but it is still a political force to be reckoned with. Unaffiliated Palestinian clans have refused to join in a post-war reconstruction effort for fear of retaliation by Hamas. Third, Israel has not been able to secure its borders. While it has regained control over some border crossings, the underground infrastructure that has allowed Hamas to engage in smuggling weapons and carrying out attacks is still in place.

[Analdou Agency reported that a former Mossad chief had stated that Israel was unequovically losing the war in Gaza.](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-on-losing-end-in-gaza-war-former-mossad-deputy-chief/3223179). Even Zionist publishers like [JP reported this](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-803955).

[As CNN has reported, Hamas has remained wholly combat effective.](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/08/middleeast/gaza-israel-hamas-battalions-invs-intl/). This is a pattern that staretd early in the war. By December, the IDF was declaring most Hamas batallions to have been dismantled.

This was quickly revealed to be a propaganda lie. As in early 2024, reports emerged that Hamas had begun rehabilitating its batallions in North Gaza. Reports from the Neo-Conservative think tank isw argued that as much as 80% of Hamas' fighting strength was restored. 

According to the isw's report on MArch 27th, they argue that this means Palestinian fighters ""retain  significant degree of combat effectiveness in the area, despite continued Israeli clearing efforts around Gaza City."" and that ""The return of Israeli forces to [Zaytoun] suggests that Palestinian militias continue to operate there similar to how these militias still have a presence in other portions of the northern Gaza Strip.""

We can also check pretty much every battle in Gaza to see how this is true.

The first battle in Gaza was the battle of Beit Hanoun. Despite IDF claims, they never occupied the city. And the battle is considered as having ended in a Palestinian victory. The isw reported that when the IDF left in December, the P-JOR continued effective control over Beit Hanoun. Beit Hanoun was used as a base to attack the IDF and send rockets into Israel, demonstrating that teh IDF had failed to defeat the JOR in Beit Hanoun.

Then we have the First Battle of Jabalia. As the isw reported, Hamas retained control of Jabalia after Israel withdrew in May. 

&gt; ""These points taken together reflect the degree to which Hamas and other Palestinian militias remain combat effective in and around Jabalia. Hamas and the other militias will almost certainly resume their efforts to reconstitute there as the IDF units have left.""

Then we have the Battle of Shuja'iyya. Though the IDF declared victory here, heavy casualties forced them to withdraw and as al-Jazeera reported, Palestinians retained control of the city. Further evidence of Palestinain control is that several months later, the IDF returned to the region to try and wrestle control away from the JOR.

This 2nd battle was just as disastrous for the IDF. After retreating in July, Hamas and the PIJ retained dominance in the city. Again, al-Jazeera reported how this had occured. But not stopping there, when the IDF withdrew in videos from the area one could see Palestinian militants with guns in their hands standing around in broad daylight. Alongside this, government officials working for the P-JOR immediately remerged in the city, as if they had never left, and reasserted doubly Palestinian control in the region.

Then we have the siege of Khan Yunis. The first Israeli assualt ended in abject failure. so great was the routing of the IDF they withdrew from all of southern Gaza. Khan Yunis itself remained under the control of the Joint Operations Room. Again, as reported by the isw. The 2nd and 3rd battles ended in much the same way and in far shorter timespans.

Then comes al-Qarara. By all acounts, a Palestinian victory.The isw reported that Israel was defeated in al-Qarara. They had failed to achieve any of their aims. P-JOR remained in control. No high ranking militants were found or killed, and accordinng to anaylsts, Hamas remained combat effective in the region.

This is how every battle that has ended thus far has gone. Israel went in, killed civilians for a few weeks. Ran into resistance, tried to fight back, upon seeing heavy casualties retreated with Palestine still in control.

This is not what victory looks like. Israel is, by all measures losing.","The evidence that Hamas is in fact, beating the IDF in Gaza",0.18,0,0,11/30/2024 16:33,1,Pro-Israel

Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence, who prevented holocaust survivors from seeking refuge in the British Mandate.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted. Please research the ways Palestinians are treated in Lebanon and Jordan, where they are banned from certain professions, from owning property, from having full citizenship, all so they can be used as a political tool to put pressure on Israel.

No war can be fought without civilian casualties, this includes women &amp; children. I do grieve them.

However, Israel neither wanted nor started this war. The deaths are Hamas' responsibility, ultimately.

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.",It's Barack Obama's fault that the Peace Process collapsed. ,0.41,0,0,12/02/2024 08:35,0,Neutral

The offensive continues to have momentum and it is unclear how much territory will change hands. There is unrest across the country and fighting and rumors of a coup attempt in Damascus, though it is not clear what is happening and that fighting may be against rebel cells.

As far as I am aware, Syria is not directly involved in the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon, but Assad's government is hostile to Israel and one of Hezbollah and Iran's major allies. There is speculation that the rebel attack may have been prompted by the military weakness of Hezbollah and Iran in the wake of conflict with Israel. Syria borders Israel and is only 30 miles from the West Bank at its closest point.

At a minimum, conflict in Syria will further deplete the resources of the Iranian-led alliance and reduce their ability to engage in Lebanon or Gaza. More Hezbollah forces may move into Syria after the ceasefire, or maybe Hezbollah is too depleted to send any more support. In the extreme case Assad may fall and be replaced by another general from within his faction, or by some sort of rebel government. I have no idea what the implications of regime change would be. I don't think it is likely that conflict will spill into Israel directly because the Golan Heights border is well defended, but renewed conflict might change the situation in Lebanon or on Israel's northern border.

I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement? 

And this isn’t the only conflict in the world. It’s not even the largest by people killed or involved. Here is a map that shows all current conflicts. https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker

People deny this is rooted in antisemitism and I want to believe they’re accurate, but in our community, we just can’t come up with any other reason!

**I am asking because my best friend is Palestinian from Jaffa. Recently, we went to a Palestinian restaurant in the USA with her mom. The decorations in the restaurant focused a lot on Israeli oppression and Palestinian resistance. My friend looked uncomfortable and sad. Later, she told me that resistance is important, but it makes her sad that Palestinian culture is now often defined by its connection to Israel more than anything else. She said that Palestinian culture is so much bigger than that.**

**This made me wonder how other Palestinians (living in Palestine/Israel or outside) feel about how Palestinian culture is seen in the world these days. I would love to hear any feelings and thoughts if you are comfortable sharing...**

**Do you feel that Palestinian culture is now mostly defined by its resistance to Israel? Or do you think that oversimplifies the situation?**

**Has the focus on resistance changed how you see your Palestinian identity? Do you like (or need) the focus on resistance right now more than anything else?**

**Are there parts of Palestinian culture that you wish were better known or more celebrated by people around the world?**

**I would ask those who are not Palestinian or from the Diaspora to refrain from commenting unless they also have questions around Palestinian culture and thoughts/feelings.**

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

Yet, despite this significant offer, none of the 101 hostages have been successfully returned so far. What makes this even more perplexing is the clear evidence that some of the hostages are being sheltered and cared for by Gazan civilians. This raises an unsettling question: how could a father, who has the chance to secure safety, a better future for his family, and an improved quality of life, choose instead to keep a hostage? 

This decision defies logic on multiple levels. It is not just about the economic or material benefits offered by Israel. The offer promises a lifeline, an escape from the hardships and dangers that many Gazan civilians face daily. Accepting such an offer would theoretically guarantee safety from ongoing conflicts, access to better healthcare and education, and a future of stability. Yet, the fact that no one has taken advantage of this opportunity suggests a deeper, more troubling dynamic at play.

It leads me to consider whether hatred toward Israelis surpasses the love for their own children among some Gazans. Is the hostility so deeply ingrained that it eclipses even the instinctual drive to protect and provide for their families? This possibility is deeply unsettling, as it speaks to a cycle of animosity that overrides self-preservation and the pursuit of a better life.

3142,m005pq6,1,"I think overall you're probably right that this has never been a serious plan, just something that a faction of opportunists have tried to lever in to the ongoing war. The only counterpoints I would say that should give cause for concern there are that -

a. the current Israeli government is quite right wing, and a party in power doesn't need to have majority support for all it's policies, it just needs majority support within its party while in power. If most of the ruling coalition want to do it, they might be able to whip or leverage the rest of the coalition into agreeing to it in exchange for some other policy that others want. The factions in Israel that oppose more settlements don't actually care very much, while the factions that support settlements care a lot, so political trades could be quite easy.

b. Israel's ""siege mentality"" leads a lot of Israelis to believe that it doesn't matter what they do, they'll always be opposed to the maximum possible extent anyway. The logical follow-on for some is that they may as well take whatever they can, as they can't be hated any more than they are, so why not? Simultaneously, under international law, buffer zones are forbidden in the same way as settlements, so they'd already be violating the Geneva Conventions with the less extreme approach. Some will think they may as well get their monies worth and do some conquering.",IsraelPalestine,12/02/2024 07:27,1h42p22,nothingpersonnelmate,0,1,0,TRUE,5/21/2024 9:02,0,0,13,15285,15298,1,"My argument is if the former top Israel war cabinet had considered all of Gaza Strip to be part of Israeli land (some call it Greater Israel ), then it would not have flatten much of Gaza. If you think Gaza belongs to you, your property, you would not have flatten much of Gaza. I still think the current top Israeli leadership also doesnt want to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip.

1. Ben-Gurion and early zionists may have commented on Greater Israel. But time has changed, the current top leadership is no Ben-Gurion. Similarly, Trump is no Biden. The government policies will change depending on the leader and changes with the time.

2. Daniella Weiss, Ben-Gvir, Smotrich and other extreme right wings may be salivating at the idea of re-establishing Gush Katif settlements (formerly near Khan Yunis) in the southern Gaza Strip. But none of them were part of the former top Israeli war cabinet, and even currently they do not direct or lead the war. They may try, but this is not official government policy. 

I am trying to explain that is/was not the intention of Israel/IDF to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip. It’s kinda an ancient war maxime (idk what is it called), but you dont destroy the land/ all the buildings if you want to conquer itand considered that land belongs to you.

3. During WW2, Germany didnt destroy Paris. They tried when they were losing and evacuating, but not at the start. They wanted Paris to be intact. And you would too if you are conquering Paris. There is a suggestion (some might dispute it) that the German leader who cannot be named during WW2, did not REALLY wanted to conquer Britain. After defeating France, Germany thought Britain would make peace. There were lots of destruction during the Battle of Britain especially London.

4. US dropped nuclear bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, flatten them. US had no intention of permanently conquering Japan. US never saw Japan as part of US land. US wanted to end the war, and thought using nuclear bomb will do that, and it did, Japan surrendered. US was in Japan for a bit to sort things out then quickly handed over to a transitional Japanese government. US had no intention of conquering Japan.

5. US dropped more than 7.5 million tons of bombs in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. US had no intention of permanently conquering Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos. It’s easier to completely destroy something you dont want/need and even easier if you are not the one going to clean up the mess later down the line. See the pattern….Israel has no intention of funding the rebuilding of Gaza with Israeli money. But that doesnt mean Israel will prevent others from funding the rebuilding of Gaza, mainly from donations from USA, Europe, Arab, Muslim countries and rest of international world but not Israel.

6. I dont have the facts, can someone check how was the six days war fought in Jerusalem ? If my theory is correct, my prediction would be, there should be minimal destruction in Jerusalem. Israel wants/wanted Jerusalem, and to be intact, not flatten. See the difference with Gaza Strip. 

7. What is Jerusalem worth ? Saladdin replied Nothing, then said Everything. I am not saying its historically accurate, i wanted to emphasize how people think. Jerusalem is worth nothing and everything. You wont want to destroy something that valuable. 

8. At the beginning of the Ukraine war, did you noticed the Russia’s attack was very tactical and calculated…lets attack the telecommunication system, military bases, military airbase, railway lines etc… I think at this moment, Putin really thought Ukraine was part of Russia, so he wasnt intending to flatten Ukraine. But Putin’s invasion plans didnt go as plan, F£*&amp; it… then Russia started to change tactic and started to obliterate cities like Bahmut, Mariupol, Kharkiv, etc... Well, if Putin cant have Ukraine, nobody else can…. might as well flatten it. 

9. Even if any US states try to secede from USA, the US military is unlikely going to flatten their cities. Because Washington would have concluded that is part of US land, we shouldnt cause that much destruction. Not to mention the bad press, criticism, protests, etc… the people there are American citizens and they might have family and friends in other parts of the USA. If its not US land, well… I can tell you the approach will be very different.

10. These intentions are not static, and can change. Trump probably has a few ideas of his own and will start making changes next year. Currently, there is rumors that part of Gaza Strip in the north might be turned into a buffer zone by IDF.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

[As early as last month,](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/israel-losing-netanyahu-wont-back-down-his-war-aims) the British defence think tank reported that:

&gt; Israel is not achieving its war aims against Hamas. First, it has only obtained a handful of the hostages. Some have been killed; the fates of many others are still unknown.

Second, Hamas has not been destroyed. Destruction of a terrorist organisation is difficult to measure. Some point to leadership decapitation. However, as Jenna Jordan has pointed out, attriting terrorist leaders seldom brings about their organisations’ collapse. Factors such as popular support, ideology and organisational structure play bigger roles in deciding these groups’ fates. Another measure used to determine if a terrorist group has been destroyed is if its territorial sphere has been reduced or removed. Israel has failed to deprive Hamas of the territory it governed prior to the war. Hamas has been battered in Gaza, but it is still a political force to be reckoned with. Unaffiliated Palestinian clans have refused to join in a post-war reconstruction effort for fear of retaliation by Hamas. Third, Israel has not been able to secure its borders. While it has regained control over some border crossings, the underground infrastructure that has allowed Hamas to engage in smuggling weapons and carrying out attacks is still in place.

Even Zionist publishers like [JP reported this](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-803955).

[As CNN has reported, Hamas has remained wholly combat effective.](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/08/middleeast/gaza-israel-hamas-battalions-invs-intl/). This is a pattern that staretd early in the war. By December, the IDF was declaring most Hamas batallions to have been dismantled.

This was quickly revealed to be a propaganda lie. As in early 2024, reports emerged that Hamas had begun rehabilitating its batallions in North Gaza. Reports from the Neo-Conservative think tank isw argued that as much as 80% of Hamas' fighting strength was restored. 

According to the isw's report on MArch 27th, they argue that this means Palestinian fighters ""retain  significant degree of combat effectiveness in the area, despite continued Israeli clearing efforts around Gaza City."" and that ""The return of Israeli forces to [Zaytoun] suggests that Palestinian militias continue to operate there similar to how these militias still have a presence in other portions of the northern Gaza Strip.""

We can also check pretty much every battle in Gaza to see how this is true.

The first battle in Gaza was the battle of Beit Hanoun. Despite IDF claims, they never occupied the city. And the battle is considered as having ended in a Palestinian victory. The isw reported that when the IDF left in December, the P-JOR continued effective control over Beit Hanoun. Beit Hanoun was used as a base to attack the IDF and send rockets into Israel, demonstrating that teh IDF had failed to defeat the JOR in Beit Hanoun.

Then we have the First Battle of Jabalia. As the isw reported, Hamas retained control of Jabalia after Israel withdrew in May. 

&gt; ""These points taken together reflect the degree to which Hamas and other Palestinian militias remain combat effective in and around Jabalia. Hamas and the other militias will almost certainly resume their efforts to reconstitute there as the IDF units have left.""

Then we have the Battle of Shuja'iyya. Though the IDF declared victory here, heavy casualties forced them to withdraw and as al-Jazeera reported, Palestinians retained control of the city. Further evidence of Palestinain control is that several months later, the IDF returned to the region to try and wrestle control away from the JOR.

This 2nd battle was just as disastrous for the IDF. After retreating in July, Hamas and the PIJ retained dominance in the city. Again, al-Jazeera reported how this had occured. But not stopping there, when the IDF withdrew in videos from the area one could see Palestinian militants with guns in their hands standing around in broad daylight. Alongside this, government officials working for the P-JOR immediately remerged in the city, as if they had never left, and reasserted doubly Palestinian control in the region.

Then we have the siege of Khan Yunis. The first Israeli assualt ended in abject failure. so great was the routing of the IDF they withdrew from all of southern Gaza. Khan Yunis itself remained under the control of the Joint Operations Room. Again, as reported by the isw. The 2nd and 3rd battles ended in much the same way and in far shorter timespans.

Then comes al-Qarara. By all acounts, a Palestinian victory.The isw reported that Israel was defeated in al-Qarara. They had failed to achieve any of their aims. P-JOR remained in control. No high ranking militants were found or killed, and accordinng to anaylsts, Hamas remained combat effective in the region.

4642,lzvxaq2,5,"&gt; Early writings about zionisim when confronted with the demographic reality (of palestinans living there) did suggest ethnic cleansing as one of the ""tools"" to achieve that.

Which I addressed as not being the voice of the movement but the individuals who wrote those texts. Bin Laden wrote a letter to America and declared a Jihad on the West after releasing a Sharia based fatwa supporting his extremism that was corroborated by his twisted interpretation of Islamic texts. Does that mean all Muslims around the globe were obligated by Islam to declare a Jihad on the West? Look to reason please. 

&gt; What is more, the very concept of forming a jewish majority state in an already populated region requires ethnic cleansing and violence to be achieved. 

Not really. Initially, the plan was to establish Israel as a secular nation on a non-sovereign territory governed by the British. A couple regions in Africa like Ethiopia and Uganda were proposed but that discussion went nowhere because the Jews in the political sphere wanted to establish a state in Mandatory Palestine which both was a non-sovereign territory under British governance and a place that held great religious significance in the Jewish culture. The problem is that unlike Ugandans and Ethiopians, Muslim Palestinian for some reason felt quite entitled to a land that they just happen to live in and share with others, and demanded sovereignty to establish a Muslim state in the region governed by Sharia Law following the collapse of Ottoman Empire. The establishment of another state in that region spelt the end of that dream. Hence the hostilities that begun following the signing of the Balfour declaration and the massive influx of Jewish immigrants following the first and second World Wars.

I’d still like to believe that but much of what has happened in response to this conflict makes that hard. I’m not getting why,if not for antisemitism, are people are so anti-Zionist and why this conflict is so focussed on. I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement? 

And this isn’t the only conflict in the world. It’s not even the largest by people killed or involved. Here is a map that shows all current conflicts. https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker

Why is the focus on Ukraine minimal when it is one if the most despicable wars ever with the potential of the collapse of Western society? 

People deny this is rooted in antisemitism and I want to believe they’re accurate, but in our community, we just can’t come up with any other reason! So if you are Anti-Zionist, what do you think Zionism is? Do we not have the right to self define? Is the definition offensive to you?

There's certainly a scriptural basis for the idea of Jews having a *connection* to the land of Israel, but there's nothing I've found in the Jewish tradition/scriture that says Jews need to be in the majority.

I'm not challenging the idea that it should be majority Jewish.

It seems fighting is still continuing by Israelis against Hezbollah.   

As far as I know, Israel couldn't negotiate a deal to end hezbollah but instead negotiated a deal to only move hezbollah north of the litani and not allow new weapon supplies, but it did not mention any ideas of disarming hezbollah north of the litani. This was the ceasefire terms agreed upon both sides.   

While it would have been better for Lebanese and for Israelis to have a deal ensuring disarming Hezbollah as a foreign backed militia in Lebanon, this was not the deal Israel was achieved.   

Ever since the ceasefire, Israel has continued attacks on what it claims are hezbollah targets, but they are doing so even north of the Litani river where the deal that both sides agreed to did not mention that hezbollah can't operate there.   

I'm afraid this will do nothing but put anyone who opposes hezbollah from the Lebanese side in a bad position because this would only prove that you can't trust israeli ceasefires and terms. This will only give hezbollah more reasons to remain legitimate and will dismiss any Lebanese efforts to take control.

&gt; The military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria into Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect, which the military said was a violation of its terms. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities or Hezbollah.

I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things.

What they do not realise is that the opposite is true. Not only is defeat possible, but in Gaza, they are winning.

For one, countless anaylsts, including those in Israel have commented that Israel has already lost the war. And that it cannot beat Hamas or the Palestinian Joint-Operations Room.

[As early as last month,](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/israel-losing-netanyahu-wont-back-down-his-war-aims) the British defence think tank reported that:

&gt; Israel is not achieving its war aims against Hamas. First, it has only obtained a handful of the hostages. Some have been killed; the fates of many others are still unknown.

Second, Hamas has not been destroyed. Destruction of a terrorist organisation is difficult to measure. Some point to leadership decapitation. However, as Jenna Jordan has pointed out, attriting terrorist leaders seldom brings about their organisations’ collapse. Factors such as popular support, ideology and organisational structure play bigger roles in deciding these groups’ fates. Another measure used to determine if a terrorist group has been destroyed is if its territorial sphere has been reduced or removed. Israel has failed to deprive Hamas of the territory it governed prior to the war. Hamas has been battered in Gaza, but it is still a political force to be reckoned with. Unaffiliated Palestinian clans have refused to join in a post-war reconstruction effort for fear of retaliation by Hamas. Third, Israel has not been able to secure its borders. While it has regained control over some border crossings, the underground infrastructure that has allowed Hamas to engage in smuggling weapons and carrying out attacks is still in place.

[Analdou Agency reported that a former Mossad chief had stated that Israel was unequovically losing the war in Gaza.](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-on-losing-end-in-gaza-war-former-mossad-deputy-chief/3223179). Even Zionist publishers like [JP reported this](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-803955).

[As CNN has reported, Hamas has remained wholly combat effective.](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/08/middleeast/gaza-israel-hamas-battalions-invs-intl/). This is a pattern that staretd early in the war. By December, the IDF was declaring most Hamas batallions to have been dismantled.

This was quickly revealed to be a propaganda lie. As in early 2024, reports emerged that Hamas had begun rehabilitating its batallions in North Gaza. Reports from the Neo-Conservative think tank isw argued that as much as 80% of Hamas' fighting strength was restored. 

According to the isw's report on MArch 27th, they argue that this means Palestinian fighters ""retain  significant degree of combat effectiveness in the area, despite continued Israeli clearing efforts around Gaza City."" and that ""The return of Israeli forces to [Zaytoun] suggests that Palestinian militias continue to operate there similar to how these militias still have a presence in other portions of the northern Gaza Strip.""

We can also check pretty much every battle in Gaza to see how this is true.

The first battle in Gaza was the battle of Beit Hanoun. Despite IDF claims, they never occupied the city. And the battle is considered as having ended in a Palestinian victory. The isw reported that when the IDF left in December, the P-JOR continued effective control over Beit Hanoun. Beit Hanoun was used as a base to attack the IDF and send rockets into Israel, demonstrating that teh IDF had failed to defeat the JOR in Beit Hanoun.

Then we have the First Battle of Jabalia. As the isw reported, Hamas retained control of Jabalia after Israel withdrew in May. 

&gt; ""These points taken together reflect the degree to which Hamas and other Palestinian militias remain combat effective in and around Jabalia. Hamas and the other militias will almost certainly resume their efforts to reconstitute there as the IDF units have left.""

Then we have the Battle of Shuja'iyya. Though the IDF declared victory here, heavy casualties forced them to withdraw and as al-Jazeera reported, Palestinians retained control of the city. Further evidence of Palestinain control is that several months later, the IDF returned to the region to try and wrestle control away from the JOR.

This 2nd battle was just as disastrous for the IDF. After retreating in July, Hamas and the PIJ retained dominance in the city. Again, al-Jazeera reported how this had occured. But not stopping there, when the IDF withdrew in videos from the area one could see Palestinian militants with guns in their hands standing around in broad daylight. Alongside this, government officials working for the P-JOR immediately remerged in the city, as if they had never left, and reasserted doubly Palestinian control in the region.

Then we have the siege of Khan Yunis. The first Israeli assualt ended in abject failure. so great was the routing of the IDF they withdrew from all of southern Gaza.

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.",It's Barack Obama's fault that the Peace Process collapsed. ,0.41,0,0,12/02/2024 08:35,0,Neutral

https://x.com/MTVEnglishNews/status/1863159187968045521   

It seems fighting is still continuing by Israelis against Hezbollah.   

As far as I know, Israel couldn't negotiate a deal to end hezbollah but instead negotiated a deal to only move hezbollah north of the litani and not allow new weapon supplies, but it did not mention any ideas of disarming hezbollah north of the litani. This was the ceasefire terms agreed upon both sides.   

While it would have been better for Lebanese and for Israelis to have a deal ensuring disarming Hezbollah as a foreign backed militia in Lebanon, this was not the deal Israel was achieved.   

Ever since the ceasefire, Israel has continued attacks on what it claims are hezbollah targets, but they are doing so even north of the Litani river where the deal that both sides agreed to did not mention that hezbollah can't operate there.   

I'm afraid this will do nothing but put anyone who opposes hezbollah from the Lebanese side in a bad position because this would only prove that you can't trust israeli ceasefires and terms. This will only give hezbollah more reasons to remain legitimate and will dismiss any Lebanese efforts to take control.     
   
   
EDIT: From one of the replies:

[link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/israel-hezbollah-syria-ceasefire-gaza-world-central-kitchen/)

&gt; An Israeli airstrike on a car in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed five people, including employees of World Central Kitchen. The charity said it was ""urgently seeking more details"" after Israel's military said it targeted a WCK worker who was part of the Hamas attack that sparked the war.

&gt; Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites along Syria's border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said Saturday, testing a fragile, days-old ceasefire that has seen continued sporadic fire.

&gt; The military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria into Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect, which the military said was a violation of its terms. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities or Hezbollah.

Hezbollah smuggling arms is a clear violation of ceasefire terms

However, that does not explain why Israel has bombed a member of the Lebanese Army in the far north. They're also destroying random buildings in the south, that was not part of any agreement.

I’d still like to believe that but much of what has happened in response to this conflict makes that hard. I’m not getting why,if not for antisemitism, are people are so anti-Zionist and why this conflict is so focussed on. I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement? 

And this isn’t the only conflict in the world. It’s not even the largest by people killed or involved. Here is a map that shows all current conflicts. https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker

The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

""Woeful is the fate of anyone who attempts to enforce these unlawful warrants. Let me remind them all, in a friendly manner: the U.S. law regarding the International Criminal Court is known as the 'Hague Invasion Law' for a good reason. Think about it."" This quote comes from a social media post where Republican Senator Tom Cotton criticizes the arrest warrants issued against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.

In fact, the U.S. law protecting military personnel allows for military action to free any American or allied citizen detained by the court in The Hague. This law was passed in 2002, the same year the International Criminal Court began its operations, and one year before the invasion of Iraq. In 2020, following the court's announcement of an investigation into war crimes in Afghanistan committed by all parties, including the United States, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and another official, Fakeso Mochosoku. Additionally, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced restrictions on visa issuance for unnamed individuals involved in the court’s efforts to investigate American nationals. By the end of 2021, under pressure, the ICC announced that investigating U.S. involvement in war crimes in Afghanistan was no longer a priority, citing that the worst crimes had been committed by the Taliban and ISIS-Khorasan.

In this context, signing the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court in 1998 marked the establishment of a justice system for a unipolar world, following the definitive end of the Cold War in favor of the United States and the Western bloc. Much like the Nuremberg Trials, the victors impose their justice, and only the losers are tried. In a brief period of global dominance by the West, the International Criminal Court was meant to be a permanent Nuremberg-like tribunal where the enemies of the new empire and its rebels would be prosecuted. On the other hand, the desire to extend the court’s jurisdiction over the entire world also signified the globalization of legal systems, including the economic, commercial, and criminal aspects. The Bush administration’s 2002 declaration rejecting membership in the court aligned with the notion of the U.S. as an institution of its own empire. U.S. absolute sovereignty in the unipolar system means it stands above international law.

Throughout its short history, most of the arrest warrants issued by the court have targeted African officials, as part of its efforts to manage the periphery of the empire. The few exceptions outside Africa were aimed at opponents in direct conflict with the West, such as Serbia in the past and Russia more recently. The arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant mark the first such warrants targeting U.S. allies.

The Biden administration has unambiguously rejected the court’s decision, and it is expected that the forthcoming Republican administration under Trump will impose even harsher sanctions on ICC officials than those seen during his first term. Meanwhile, the Hungarian government has openly defied the court by inviting Netanyahu for a visit, and European countries have shown mixed signals. It seems that this latest arrest warrant will serve as an international vote on the future and credibility of the ICC.

Ultimately, the marginalization of international justice comes in the context of a decline in U.S. enthusiasm for globalization, now shifting toward ""America First."" With China’s economic rise and the direct clash between Russia and the West, it seems that the unipolar world order, in which the ICC was founded, is under threat—or at the very least, no longer as firmly entrenched as it once appeared.",Members of the US Congress have explicitly threatened to invade The Hague if Netanyahu is arrested on the basis of issuing an arrest warrant for him. ,0.73,38,0,11/28/2024 17:49,0,Pro-Palestine

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.",It's Barack Obama's fault that the Peace Process collapsed. ,0.41,0,0,12/02/2024 08:35,0,Neutral

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

So im asking what if tomorrow there was peace and former palestinian fighters had a change of heart and became pro israel and supported israel and decided to fight for israel and joined israels armed forces wouldnt that be a very potent mix of arab fighting, jewish warrior spirit and western technology wouldnt that make the israeli army the best in the region?",If there was peace tomorrow and Palestine and Israel were at peace then would Palestine and Israel likely become the main powerhouses of MENA?,0.6,4,0,12/01/2024 05:10,-1,Pro-Palestine

There's certainly a scriptural basis for the idea of Jews having a *connection* to the land of Israel, but there's nothing I've found in the Jewish tradition/scriture that says Jews need to be in the majority. 

Or maybe something totally different? I know Israel was *planned* as a Jewish state by the UN partition plan, same as Pakistan was planned as a Muslim state.. 

I'm not challenging the idea that it should be majority Jewish.

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

It seems fighting is still continuing by Israelis against Hezbollah.   

As far as I know, Israel couldn't negotiate a deal to end hezbollah but instead negotiated a deal to only move hezbollah north of the litani and not allow new weapon supplies, but it did not mention any ideas of disarming hezbollah north of the litani. This was the ceasefire terms agreed upon both sides.   

While it would have been better for Lebanese and for Israelis to have a deal ensuring disarming Hezbollah as a foreign backed militia in Lebanon, this was not the deal Israel was achieved.   

Ever since the ceasefire, Israel has continued attacks on what it claims are hezbollah targets, but they are doing so even north of the Litani river where the deal that both sides agreed to did not mention that hezbollah can't operate there.   

I'm afraid this will do nothing but put anyone who opposes hezbollah from the Lebanese side in a bad position because this would only prove that you can't trust israeli ceasefires and terms. This will only give hezbollah more reasons to remain legitimate and will dismiss any Lebanese efforts to take control.

[link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/israel-hezbollah-syria-ceasefire-gaza-world-central-kitchen/)

&gt; An Israeli airstrike on a car in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed five people, including employees of World Central Kitchen. The charity said it was ""urgently seeking more details"" after Israel's military said it targeted a WCK worker who was part of the Hamas attack that sparked the war.

&gt; Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites along Syria's border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said Saturday, testing a fragile, days-old ceasefire that has seen continued sporadic fire.

&gt; The military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria into Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect, which the military said was a violation of its terms. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities or Hezbollah.

Hezbollah smuggling arms is a clear violation of ceasefire terms

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.",It's Barack Obama's fault that the Peace Process collapsed. ,0.41,0,0,12/02/2024 08:35,0,Neutral

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

However, Jews are not one piece. One faction is now becoming very powerful, and extremely influential in American politics: The more Conservative, Pro-Netanyahu, Florida Jews are Netanyahu's strongest power base among the American Jewish community and they are also becoming more and more powerful in the Political scene.

The Falic family, a very powerful family in the Florida Jewish community, is the biggest donor to Netanyahu, and he basically lives at their expense. They are also very right-wing. The Falics are Billionaires. They donated a lot of money to Republicans such as Ted Cruz, Ron DeSantis, and Marco Rubio and also sponsored some trips to the West Bank of Mike Pompeo and Mike Huckabee.

Former Democrat Bill Ackman, a classic Liberal jew on Paper, also left the Democrats due to their treatment of Netanyahu and started to donate to Trump. A lot of Pennsylvania Jews also voted Republican, and in recent years we see that the Liberal Jews are becoming weaker in the Democratic party while the Conservative, Pro-Netanyahu Jews are becoming more and more influential in the Republican party.

'Settler-Colonial' - This implies that people moved to the region by choice and displaced the indigenous population. Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% ethnically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel, and Arabs were not displaced until they lost their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence.

Israel is not a 'Jewish ethnostate'. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern countries, and the Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights. Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have an ethnostate, it would be Jews!

A lot of governments in the region, including a lot of the Lebanese people would like to see the region rid of Hezbollah.

Thanks for the detailed point of view!

But a small addition: in my opinion, the situation with Egypt is quite complicated... Seems like a huge part of society is very anti-Israeli there (and was before the Oct.7) and the appearance of good relations at the government level could be a tempor thing. For example, the journalist Dalia Ziada left her homeland Egypt because she was constantly receiving threats, they started hunting her (simply because she started talking in Arabic specifically about the events of October 7 and publishing Hamas videos) the police didnt protect her according to her words.

This is a multi-million population there that could potentially also become radicalized. Whose government clearly did not do enough to control the border (weapons were sent across the border with Egypt).

A friend of mine works for a European company that deals with luxury cars to order (these are cars of such a level that only a few dozen are produced per year their prices are as high as possible) and he was shocked to see that Egyptian clients are some of the most frequent their customers. Corruption is apparently on a huge scale there. Sooner or later, someone may take advantage of this... However, these are general thoughts.

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

The Franks were not brutal racist maniacs.  Zionists aren't aiming to rewrite how human civilizations work.   They were just aiming to form there own.  They intend to follow the proven successful pattern. 

&gt; So why doesn't Israel elevating a race trouble you?

I don't think they have committed to doing that.  Certainly there are signs they might.  And if they choose a racial definition of ""Jewish"" then Zionism does become racism.  But Zionism itself rejects the idea that Jewish was a religion or race and instead defines Jewish as a nationality.  As long as that definition remains viable that's I'm giving Israel the benefit of the doubt.

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.",It's Barack Obama's fault that the Peace Process collapsed. ,0.41,0,0,12/02/2024 08:35,1,Pro-Israel

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

https://x.com/MTVEnglishNews/status/1863159187968045521   

It seems fighting is still continuing by Israelis against Hezbollah.   

As far as I know, Israel couldn't negotiate a deal to end hezbollah but instead negotiated a deal to only move hezbollah north of the litani and not allow new weapon supplies, but it did not mention any ideas of disarming hezbollah north of the litani. This was the ceasefire terms agreed upon both sides.   

While it would have been better for Lebanese and for Israelis to have a deal ensuring disarming Hezbollah as a foreign backed militia in Lebanon, this was not the deal Israel was achieved.   

Ever since the ceasefire, Israel has continued attacks on what it claims are hezbollah targets, but they are doing so even north of the Litani river where the deal that both sides agreed to did not mention that hezbollah can't operate there.   

I'm afraid this will do nothing but put anyone who opposes hezbollah from the Lebanese side in a bad position because this would only prove that you can't trust israeli ceasefires and terms. This will only give hezbollah more reasons to remain legitimate and will dismiss any Lebanese efforts to take control.     
   
   
EDIT: From one of the replies:

[link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/israel-hezbollah-syria-ceasefire-gaza-world-central-kitchen/)

&gt; An Israeli airstrike on a car in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed five people, including employees of World Central Kitchen. The charity said it was ""urgently seeking more details"" after Israel's military said it targeted a WCK worker who was part of the Hamas attack that sparked the war.

&gt; Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites along Syria's border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said Saturday, testing a fragile, days-old ceasefire that has seen continued sporadic fire.

&gt; The military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria into Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect, which the military said was a violation of its terms. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities or Hezbollah.

Hezbollah smuggling arms is a clear violation of ceasefire terms

However, that does not explain why Israel has bombed a member of the Lebanese Army in the far north. They're also destroying random buildings in the south, that was not part of any agreement.

https://x.com/MTVEnglishNews/status/1863159187968045521   

It seems fighting is still continuing by Israelis against Hezbollah.   

As far as I know, Israel couldn't negotiate a deal to end hezbollah but instead negotiated a deal to only move hezbollah north of the litani and not allow new weapon supplies, but it did not mention any ideas of disarming hezbollah north of the litani. This was the ceasefire terms agreed upon both sides.   

While it would have been better for Lebanese and for Israelis to have a deal ensuring disarming Hezbollah as a foreign backed militia in Lebanon, this was not the deal Israel was achieved.   

Ever since the ceasefire, Israel has continued attacks on what it claims are hezbollah targets, but they are doing so even north of the Litani river where the deal that both sides agreed to did not mention that hezbollah can't operate there.   

I'm afraid this will do nothing but put anyone who opposes hezbollah from the Lebanese side in a bad position because this would only prove that you can't trust israeli ceasefires and terms. This will only give hezbollah more reasons to remain legitimate and will dismiss any Lebanese efforts to take control.     
   
   
EDIT: From one of the replies:

&gt; An Israeli airstrike on a car in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed five people, including employees of World Central Kitchen. The charity said it was ""urgently seeking more details"" after Israel's military said it targeted a WCK worker who was part of the Hamas attack that sparked the war.

&gt; Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites along Syria's border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said Saturday, testing a fragile, days-old ceasefire that has seen continued sporadic fire.

&gt; The military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria into Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect, which the military said was a violation of its terms. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities or Hezbollah.

Hezbollah smuggling arms is a clear violation of ceasefire terms

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

If you think Gaza belongs to you, your property, you would not have flatten much of Gaza. I still think the current top Israeli leadership also doesnt want to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip.

1. Ben-Gurion and early zionists may have commented on Greater Israel. But time has changed, the current top leadership is no Ben-Gurion. Similarly, Trump is no Biden. The government policies will change depending on the leader and changes with the time.

2. Daniella Weiss, Ben-Gvir, Smotrich and other extreme right wings may be salivating at the idea of re-establishing Gush Katif settlements (formerly near Khan Yunis) in the southern Gaza Strip. But none of them were part of the former top Israeli war cabinet, and even currently they do not direct or lead the war. They may try, but this is not official government policy. 

I am trying to explain that is/was not the intention of Israel/IDF to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip. It’s kinda an ancient war maxime (idk what is it called), but you dont destroy the land/ all the buildings if you want to conquer itand considered that land belongs to you.

3. During WW2, Germany didnt destroy Paris. They tried when they were losing and evacuating, but not at the start. They wanted Paris to be intact. And you would too if you are conquering Paris. There is a suggestion (some might dispute it) that the German leader who cannot be named during WW2, did not REALLY wanted to conquer Britain. After defeating France, Germany thought Britain would make peace. There were lots of destruction during the Battle of Britain especially London.

4. US dropped nuclear bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, flatten them. US had no intention of permanently conquering Japan. US never saw Japan as part of US land. US wanted to end the war, and thought using nuclear bomb will do that, and it did, Japan surrendered. US was in Japan for a bit to sort things out then quickly handed over to a transitional Japanese government. US had no intention of conquering Japan.

5. US dropped more than 7.5 million tons of bombs in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. US had no intention of permanently conquering Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos. It’s easier to completely destroy something you dont want/need and even easier if you are not the one going to clean up the mess later down the line. See the pattern….Israel has no intention of funding the rebuilding of Gaza with Israeli money. But that doesnt mean Israel will prevent others from funding the rebuilding of Gaza, mainly from donations from USA, Europe, Arab, Muslim countries and rest of international world but not Israel.

6. I dont have the facts, can someone check how was the six days war fought in Jerusalem ? If my theory is correct, my prediction would be, there should be minimal destruction in Jerusalem. Israel wants/wanted Jerusalem, and to be intact, not flatten. See the difference with Gaza Strip. 

7. What is Jerusalem worth ? Saladdin replied Nothing, then said Everything. I am not saying its historically accurate, i wanted to emphasize how people think. Jerusalem is worth nothing and everything. You wont want to destroy something that valuable. 

8. At the beginning of the Ukraine war, did you noticed the Russia’s attack was very tactical and calculated…lets attack the telecommunication system, military bases, military airbase, railway lines etc… I think at this moment, Putin really thought Ukraine was part of Russia, so he wasnt intending to flatten Ukraine. But Putin’s invasion plans didnt go as plan, F£*&amp; it… then Russia started to change tactic and started to obliterate cities like Bahmut, Mariupol, Kharkiv, etc... Well, if Putin cant have Ukraine, nobody else can…. might as well flatten it. 

9. Even if any US states try to secede from USA, the US military is unlikely going to flatten their cities. Because Washington would have concluded that is part of US land, we shouldnt cause that much destruction. Not to mention the bad press, criticism, protests, etc… the people there are American citizens and they might have family and friends in other parts of the USA. If its not US land, well… I can tell you the approach will be very different.

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

4843,lzvgqel,5,"Yes, seriously. There is absolutely zero appetite in Israel for annexing Gaza.

If you think Gaza belongs to you, your property, you would not have flatten much of Gaza. I still think the current top Israeli leadership also doesnt want to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip.

1. Ben-Gurion and early zionists may have commented on Greater Israel. But time has changed, the current top leadership is no Ben-Gurion. Similarly, Trump is no Biden. The government policies will change depending on the leader and changes with the time.

2. Daniella Weiss, Ben-Gvir, Smotrich and other extreme right wings may be salivating at the idea of re-establishing Gush Katif settlements (formerly near Khan Yunis) in the southern Gaza Strip. But none of them were part of the former top Israeli war cabinet, and even currently they do not direct or lead the war. They may try, but this is not official government policy. 

I am trying to explain that is/was not the intention of Israel/IDF to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip. It’s kinda an ancient war maxime (idk what is it called), but you dont destroy the land/ all the buildings if you want to conquer itand considered that land belongs to you.

3. During WW2, Germany didnt destroy Paris. They tried when they were losing and evacuating, but not at the start. They wanted Paris to be intact. And you would too if you are conquering Paris. There is a suggestion (some might dispute it) that the German leader who cannot be named during WW2, did not REALLY wanted to conquer Britain. After defeating France, Germany thought Britain would make peace. There were lots of destruction during the Battle of Britain especially London.

4. US dropped nuclear bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, flatten them. US had no intention of permanently conquering Japan. US never saw Japan as part of US land. US wanted to end the war, and thought using nuclear bomb will do that, and it did, Japan surrendered. US was in Japan for a bit to sort things out then quickly handed over to a transitional Japanese government. US had no intention of conquering Japan.

5. US dropped more than 7.5 million tons of bombs in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. US had no intention of permanently conquering Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos. It’s easier to completely destroy something you dont want/need and even easier if you are not the one going to clean up the mess later down the line. See the pattern….Israel has no intention of funding the rebuilding of Gaza with Israeli money. But that doesnt mean Israel will prevent others from funding the rebuilding of Gaza, mainly from donations from USA, Europe, Arab, Muslim countries and rest of international world but not Israel.

6. I dont have the facts, can someone check how was the six days war fought in Jerusalem ? If my theory is correct, my prediction would be, there should be minimal destruction in Jerusalem. Israel wants/wanted Jerusalem, and to be intact, not flatten. See the difference with Gaza Strip. 

7. What is Jerusalem worth ? Saladdin replied Nothing, then said Everything. I am not saying its historically accurate, i wanted to emphasize how people think. Jerusalem is worth nothing and everything. You wont want to destroy something that valuable. 

8. At the beginning of the Ukraine war, did you noticed the Russia’s attack was very tactical and calculated…lets attack the telecommunication system, military bases, military airbase, railway lines etc… I think at this moment, Putin really thought Ukraine was part of Russia, so he wasnt intending to flatten Ukraine. But Putin’s invasion plans didnt go as plan, F£*&amp; it… then Russia started to change tactic and started to obliterate cities like Bahmut, Mariupol, Kharkiv, etc... Well, if Putin cant have Ukraine, nobody else can…. might as well flatten it. 

9. Even if any US states try to secede from USA, the US military is unlikely going to flatten their cities. Because Washington would have concluded that is part of US land, we shouldnt cause that much destruction. Not to mention the bad press, criticism, protests, etc… the people there are American citizens and they might have family and friends in other parts of the USA. If its not US land, well… I can tell you the approach will be very different.

10. These intentions are not static, and can change. Trump probably has a few ideas of his own and will start making changes next year. Currently, there is rumors that part of Gaza Strip in the north might be turned into a buffer zone by IDF. I think the reason is for security purpose, not for the purpose to annex and not to settle in Gaza.

To re-start the Peace Process, Netanyahu accepted a 2 state solution in Bar Ilan and later halted settlement construction, which damaged him in his Political Base

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.",It's Barack Obama's fault that the Peace Process collapsed. ,0.41,0,0,12/02/2024 08:35,0,Neutral

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

Two of Israel's prime ministers, one in the 1970's and another in the 1990's, were part of terrorist organizations in the 1940's. Compare and contrast with Palestine, where literally every single politician and leader is either a former or active terrorist, and every meaningful political party is either an active or former terrorist organization.

And that's the difference. Hamas is, to this day, an **active** terrorist organization. Irgun and Lehi were dismantled generations ago. Fateh stopped being a terrorist organization in the late 1980's, and by the 1990's it was removed from terrorist lists. In 2006 it was considered the legitimate representation of the Palestinians, by the entire world, very much unlike Hamas. And, I'd note, the Palestinians should've been probably aware of that fact.

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.",It's Barack Obama's fault that the Peace Process collapsed. ,0.41,0,0,12/02/2024 08:35,1,Pro-Israel

Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence, who prevented holocaust survivors from seeking refuge in the British Mandate.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted. Please research the ways Palestinians are treated in Lebanon and Jordan, where they are banned from certain professions, from owning property, from having full citizenship, all so they can be used as a political tool to put pressure on Israel.

I’d still like to believe that but much of what has happened in response to this conflict makes that hard. I’m not getting why,if not for antisemitism, are people are so anti-Zionist and why this conflict is so focussed on. I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement? 

And this isn’t the only conflict in the world. It’s not even the largest by people killed or involved. Here is a map that shows all current conflicts. https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker

Why is the focus on Ukraine minimal when it is one if the most despicable wars ever with the potential of the collapse of Western society? 

People deny this is rooted in antisemitism and I want to believe they’re accurate, but in our community, we just can’t come up with any other reason! So if you are Anti-Zionist, what do you think Zionism is? Do we not have the right to self define? Is the definition offensive to you?

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally.

I know the general idea was to create a place where Jews would be safe, and I suppose that's the main reason to keep a Jewish majority. 

But are there other reasons?  Maybe some scriptural basis for needing to be majority Jewish?  I can't find any so far.  There's certainly a scriptural basis for the idea of Jews having a *connection* to the land of Israel, but there's nothing I've found in the Jewish tradition/scriture that says Jews need to be in the majority. 

Or maybe something totally different? I know Israel was *planned* as a Jewish state by the UN partition plan, same as Pakistan was planned as a Muslim state.. 

I'm not challenging the idea that it should be majority Jewish. (There's basically no such thing as a state whose native ethnic people has not remained in the majority -- France, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Germany, especially Japan, etc., all remain something like 85%-95% ethnically homogeneous.  So I don't see anything strange about Jews being the majority in Israel.)

Yet, despite this significant offer, none of the 101 hostages have been successfully returned so far. What makes this even more perplexing is the clear evidence that some of the hostages are being sheltered and cared for by Gazan civilians. This raises an unsettling question: how could a father, who has the chance to secure safety, a better future for his family, and an improved quality of life, choose instead to keep a hostage? 

This decision defies logic on multiple levels. It is not just about the economic or material benefits offered by Israel. The offer promises a lifeline, an escape from the hardships and dangers that many Gazan civilians face daily. Accepting such an offer would theoretically guarantee safety from ongoing conflicts, access to better healthcare and education, and a future of stability. Yet, the fact that no one has taken advantage of this opportunity suggests a deeper, more troubling dynamic at play.

It leads me to consider whether hatred toward Israelis surpasses the love for their own children among some Gazans. Is the hostility so deeply ingrained that it eclipses even the instinctual drive to protect and provide for their families? This possibility is deeply unsettling, as it speaks to a cycle of animosity that overrides self-preservation and the pursuit of a better life.

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

It seems fighting is still continuing by Israelis against Hezbollah.   

As far as I know, Israel couldn't negotiate a deal to end hezbollah but instead negotiated a deal to only move hezbollah north of the litani and not allow new weapon supplies, but it did not mention any ideas of disarming hezbollah north of the litani. This was the ceasefire terms agreed upon both sides.   

While it would have been better for Lebanese and for Israelis to have a deal ensuring disarming Hezbollah as a foreign backed militia in Lebanon, this was not the deal Israel was achieved.   

Ever since the ceasefire, Israel has continued attacks on what it claims are hezbollah targets, but they are doing so even north of the Litani river where the deal that both sides agreed to did not mention that hezbollah can't operate there.   

I'm afraid this will do nothing but put anyone who opposes hezbollah from the Lebanese side in a bad position because this would only prove that you can't trust israeli ceasefires and terms. This will only give hezbollah more reasons to remain legitimate and will dismiss any Lebanese efforts to take control.

&gt; An Israeli airstrike on a car in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed five people, including employees of World Central Kitchen. The charity said it was ""urgently seeking more details"" after Israel's military said it targeted a WCK worker who was part of the Hamas attack that sparked the war.

&gt; Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites along Syria's border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said Saturday, testing a fragile, days-old ceasefire that has seen continued sporadic fire.

&gt; The military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria into Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect, which the military said was a violation of its terms. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities or Hezbollah.

Hezbollah smuggling arms is a clear violation of ceasefire terms

There is unrest across the country and fighting and rumors of a coup attempt in Damascus, though it is not clear what is happening and that fighting may be against rebel cells.

As far as I am aware, Syria is not directly involved in the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon, but Assad's government is hostile to Israel and one of Hezbollah and Iran's major allies. There is speculation that the rebel attack may have been prompted by the military weakness of Hezbollah and Iran in the wake of conflict with Israel. Syria borders Israel and is only 30 miles from the West Bank at its closest point.

At a minimum, conflict in Syria will further deplete the resources of the Iranian-led alliance and reduce their ability to engage in Lebanon or Gaza. More Hezbollah forces may move into Syria after the ceasefire, or maybe Hezbollah is too depleted to send any more support. In the extreme case Assad may fall and be replaced by another general from within his faction, or by some sort of rebel government. I have no idea what the implications of regime change would be.

There's certainly a scriptural basis for the idea of Jews having a *connection* to the land of Israel, but there's nothing I've found in the Jewish tradition/scriture that says Jews need to be in the majority.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence, who prevented holocaust survivors from seeking refuge in the British Mandate.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted.

Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces.

However, Jews are not one piece. One faction is now becoming very powerful, and extremely influential in American politics: The more Conservative, Pro-Netanyahu, Florida Jews are Netanyahu's strongest power base among the American Jewish community and they are also becoming more and more powerful in the Political scene.

The Falic family, a very powerful family in the Florida Jewish community, is the biggest donor to Netanyahu, and he basically lives at their expense. They are also very right-wing. The Falics are Billionaires. They donated a lot of money to Republicans such as Ted Cruz, Ron DeSantis, and Marco Rubio and also sponsored some trips to the West Bank of Mike Pompeo and Mike Huckabee.

Former Democrat Bill Ackman, a classic Liberal jew on Paper, also left the Democrats due to their treatment of Netanyahu and started to donate to Trump. A lot of Pennsylvania Jews also voted Republican, and in recent years we see that the Liberal Jews are becoming weaker in the Democratic party while the Conservative, Pro-Netanyahu Jews are becoming more and more influential in the Republican party.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

1031,m048du3,1,"&gt;You conveniently left the part in which there were Jews living in Mandate Palestine

When the mandate ws established it was a tiny proportion of the overall population.

&gt;the territory was divided by the UN

Following a policy essentially devised by Britain and the U.S. at the urging of Zionist organizations. A division that flagrantly gerrymandered to give the maximum possible land to the minority population  with western backing.

But despite this Zionists couldn't even adhere to the partition plan which called for a multi-year transition process intended to integrate the two countries to maintain economic and social ties. Instead Zionists declared independence immediately, starting the Palestinian civil war.

&gt;Much like Lebanon and Syria were divided with Lebanon for the Christians and Syria for the Muslims, or like India and Pakistan were divided

and we all know how well that went. It is almost like western powers are wildly unqualified to play map maker with other people's land.

&gt;that none of those peoples had self determination then

Yes. Because of Colonialism. The World Zionist organization actively lobbied to the British to seize control of Palestine.

&gt;Palestinian before 1948 used to refer to the Jews living there. The Arabs living there considered themselves south Syrians.

Look if I call myself Italian but I was born and raised in Sicily does that make me no longer Sicilian? If a bunch of foreigners come in and take over Scicily is it okay to kick me out? Is ethnic cleansing from only part of an area okay?

Identifying with a larger geographic area/ethno-linguistic group does not make someone a foreigner in their own home.

What I get from your comment, and what I end up getting from a lot of Zionists, is that fundamentally you think ethnic cleansing is kind of *okay*. Sure you will deny it happened because you recognize that it is ""bad"", but you still point to India-Pakistan to justify Israel.

The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally.

With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it?

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things.

https://x.com/MTVEnglishNews/status/1863159187968045521   

It seems fighting is still continuing by Israelis against Hezbollah.   

As far as I know, Israel couldn't negotiate a deal to end hezbollah but instead negotiated a deal to only move hezbollah north of the litani and not allow new weapon supplies, but it did not mention any ideas of disarming hezbollah north of the litani. This was the ceasefire terms agreed upon both sides.   

While it would have been better for Lebanese and for Israelis to have a deal ensuring disarming Hezbollah as a foreign backed militia in Lebanon, this was not the deal Israel was achieved.   

Ever since the ceasefire, Israel has continued attacks on what it claims are hezbollah targets, but they are doing so even north of the Litani river where the deal that both sides agreed to did not mention that hezbollah can't operate there.   

I'm afraid this will do nothing but put anyone who opposes hezbollah from the Lebanese side in a bad position because this would only prove that you can't trust israeli ceasefires and terms. This will only give hezbollah more reasons to remain legitimate and will dismiss any Lebanese efforts to take control.

&gt; An Israeli airstrike on a car in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed five people, including employees of World Central Kitchen. The charity said it was ""urgently seeking more details"" after Israel's military said it targeted a WCK worker who was part of the Hamas attack that sparked the war.

&gt; Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites along Syria's border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said Saturday, testing a fragile, days-old ceasefire that has seen continued sporadic fire.

&gt; The military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria into Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect, which the military said was a violation of its terms. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities or Hezbollah.

Hezbollah smuggling arms is a clear violation of ceasefire terms

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in.

Israelis often feel they're unfairly targeted for their nationality and that you if you're Israeli or shows any Israeli culture literally anywhere, you'll receive harsh criticism, if not outright hatred.



This is absolutely the case. You simply can't even mention Israel at all, or talk about the cutlure of Tel Aviv or Haifa today, without people directly saying that it's all Palestinian land, you're all settlers, etc. It's simply impossible to just share you like Hebrew music or modern Israeli couscous without people bringing up the conflict.


This is especially the case if you're in any context with many people from Middle Eastern, Arab or Muslim people. They aren't known to tolerate people saying they're Israeli.


The same is also true for left-wing activist groups in the West.



It feels really unfair because most other nationalities and ethnicities can simply talk about where they're from without getting an automatic harsh reaction, but they can't. Their very existance is political.



While it's often definitely very related to antisemitism, it's also often motivated by something else, namely, geopolitics and ethnic conflicts.



The thing is, the legitimacy of the State of Israel is not uninamous. Some believe it's not a legitimate state, and it's all an illegal occupation of the sovereign country of Palestine.


You might personally believe it's outrageous and unacceptable, but it's most likely because you grew up in a context where Israel being a state isn't questioned.


But in the Arab World for example most people don't believe Israel is a legitimate state.


But the thing is, the same treatment is often given to people from other disputed or unrecognised regions or states.



For example Abkhazia, it's a partially recognised state in the Caucasus claimed by Georgia as its autonomous region. It declared secession after an ethnic conflict in the 1990s and most of the world doesn't recognise it, except for Russia.


The thing is that the same applies to Abkhazians and any, even apolitical posts about Abkhazia.



If you want to share anything happening in modern day Abkhazia, for example about some caves found there, or about their recent protests there, or their food and culture, people would inevitably bring up Georgia.





And in fact, the vast majority of people will be on the opposing side, and they won't have many people defending them and if not being on their side, at least trying to bring up nuance.


[Ironically, this happens even for people who are themselves citizens of an unrecognised state.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kosovo/comments/1eoar1h/i_want_to_relocate_from_abkhazia_to_kosovo_how_is/)


The problem isn't just that Georgians outnumber Abkhazians (like the Arab World outnumbers Israel) but rather that people that are not directly tied to the conflict will automatically take a side because this will be seen as a proxy for their politics in general. For Abkhazia, the major Western powers (for example the EU) massively support Georgia, and people in the West are against Abkhazia because they believe backing Georgia means being against Russian imperialism.


I've seen it myself, any people who try to bring any nuance to this conflict, even if they're Abkhazian themselves, are accused of being pro Russian. Same with Israel too, in some cases.


Meanwhile, for Israel, left-wing activist circles believe that Israel is a settler colonial state, therefore backing Palestinians at all times is backing decolonization.



Both of these conflicts are actually much more complex than this simplistic narrative, but people don't actually try to learn that, they take sides automatically based on some narrative they've heard.


But because of this politization, merely saying you live in Israel or Abkhazia or are Abkhazian, as opposed to Georgian for example, is seen as itself a political statement.


If you live in Sukhumi and you say you're Abkhazian, even though it's the norm in your society, and saying you're Georgian is as unacceptable as a Georgian saying they're Russian, you're told that if you want to participate in the modern world, you should say you're Georgian and live in Georgia. The same is true for Israelis. If you live in Jaffa, how can you say it's an Israeli city? And use this symbol 🇮🇱 which is very political? For the Palestinians whose family is from there, it can be offensive.


And yes, you can be seen as a settler because the state you live in is seen as illegitimate.


This is very problematic.




All that often also happens with people from other disputed regions or states (Kosovo, South Ossetia, Northern Cyprus, Crimea, Kashmir, Tibet, etc).



Personally, I feel like in both cases, this approach doesn't necessarily help people to actually resolve ethnic conflicts. Instead of actually trying to build ties and create a solution that'll satisfy everyone, for example by strengthening the opposition. For example pro Palestinian people could've supported the Israeli opposition and the Israeli diaspora itself could've been supportive of a Palestinian state and even a right of return. But no, instead, we obsess over the legality of borders and the legitimacy of states, which means people on the opposite side see us as an existential threat to their existance.









We say we're modern people but in reality we're still tribal creatures, unfortunately.


Geopolitics, governments, state sovereignity and independence is unfortunately very ingrained in all of us and it's arguably like modern day religion.



It's sad to fight against this because this doesn't become merely discrimination, but also a geopolitical opinion opposing this state, and it's very hard to draw the lines over what's acceptable and what's not. But often times, people who say that racism is unacceptable still say unacceptable things merely because of the nationality of the person.



**However, unfortunately, this is something that's very common right now and is seen as the natural thing to do. So I've created this post to try to explain the logic of those that oppose anyone automatically if they say they're ""Israelis"", to understand their motivations, to know how to possibly fight against them, and also to oppose similar situations in the Western World, where entire identities become politicised.**



In my opinion, we should really deconstruct the idea of states and nations if we actually want to achieve world peace, or at least strive towards it.


I think we should be much more mindful about how national identities shape our worldview and how people from ""disputed regions"" might still be first and foremost people and we should try to look beyond merely borders and nations, be it recognised or not.




I also believe we shouldn't see the world merely through a lense of ""states"" and ""nations"". I believe the videos and maps about ""X fun thing in every country in the world"" (for example food, music, architecture, fun facts, etc) should also include people without states or with disputed states and that it shouldn't be seen as inherently political. So yeah, including Israel, Palestine, Abkhazia, Tibet, Hawaii, Ingushetia, Tamil Nadu, Jewish diaspora etc. If our world wasn't so fixated on ""countries"", aka, sovereign states, these things would've been much less problematic.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

Yet, despite this significant offer, none of the 101 hostages have been successfully returned so far. What makes this even more perplexing is the clear evidence that some of the hostages are being sheltered and cared for by Gazan civilians. This raises an unsettling question: how could a father, who has the chance to secure safety, a better future for his family, and an improved quality of life, choose instead to keep a hostage? 

This decision defies logic on multiple levels. It is not just about the economic or material benefits offered by Israel. The offer promises a lifeline, an escape from the hardships and dangers that many Gazan civilians face daily. Accepting such an offer would theoretically guarantee safety from ongoing conflicts, access to better healthcare and education, and a future of stability. Yet, the fact that no one has taken advantage of this opportunity suggests a deeper, more troubling dynamic at play.

It leads me to consider whether hatred toward Israelis surpasses the love for their own children among some Gazans. Is the hostility so deeply ingrained that it eclipses even the instinctual drive to protect and provide for their families? This possibility is deeply unsettling, as it speaks to a cycle of animosity that overrides self-preservation and the pursuit of a better life.

He was rather ignorant.  I don't entirely disagree with Repubican claims about his inexperience.  OTOH it was hard to take them seriously when they were basking in ignorance on so many issues.    I think the most important thing he did though with respect to the Middle East was testing Iran.

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.",It's Barack Obama's fault that the Peace Process collapsed. ,0.41,0,0,12/02/2024 08:35,0,Neutral

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

I think it’s maybe hard to imagine until you’re in the situation but the reality is the human brain isn’t meant to hold all the pain of everyone in every situation, and it’s hardwired to the in-group / out-group concept. It’s is biologically normal for an Israeli to feel more grief and pain for the losses on the Israeli side and to feel distance from the pain and loss on the Palestinian side and the same is true of Palestinians, and you will see it also from their side, if you ever bring up the hostages you may find responses that pull the focus back to Palestinian suffering and that’s biologically normal. 

That being said, if you find yourself in a conversation where Gazan children come up, I think you will find that people will say that it hurts them. Not the same way Israeli losses or the plight of the hostages might, but still in a human way, the average Israeli is not apathetic to the death of children.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

2641,m00vx6p,4,"Considering that:

1. The Palestinians goal is for Israel to not exist, not just to end the occupation of the West Bank. For the Palestinians, every Israeli city is a settlement, and every Israeli is a settler.
2. The Palestinian political violence began 47 years before the first settlement was built.
3. Ending the occupation in Gaza only lead to more violence, not less.

We simply can't say that the occupation of the West Bank is what breeds more violence.

I also can't say that ""the ultimate goal is land grab"". Israel has a proven ability to return more land than Israel and Palestine combined for peace. Israel's ultimate goal is to exist as the Jewish homeland, to thrive, and to be safe. The settlements are priority #3 or #4 at most. And for many Israelis, like me, is an actual negative, not a priority at all. If the settlements were what stood between us and peace, most Israelis wouldn't mind giving them up.

Unfortunately, the Palestinians went out of their way to prove that the occupation keeps Israelis safe and at least begrudgingly tolerated. While ending the occupation makes the Israelis dead, and accused of genocide. They made it clear that the settlements might be an issue for foreign Westerners and left-wing Israelis, but it's not even close to the core issue for the Palestinians. 

I also don't agree the settlements ""eliminate the prospect of a future Palestinian state"". Most settlements are in a small settlement bloc, and the rest can be either removed, or simply exist as Israeli exclaves. And I don't get the assumption that countries with weird borders fundamentally can't exist. There are very real countries with far weirder borders than that. Nations with enclaves and exclaves, second-order enclaves and exclaves, even third-order. Nations with all of that, but in the middle of a *single city*. Archipelago nations with thousands of islands, that can never be contiguous. No matter how hard it is to have a functioning state with weird borders, it will always, always be easier than trying to integrate this into some one-state solution, when neither nation wants it.

So ultimately, it's whatever. A problem, but a secondary or tertiary one. And no, it's not really comparable to the removal of the Jewish state being the #1 priority for the Palestinians.

As for the two-state solution, yes, I do believe in the two-state solution. But the first step there, is to recognize reality, and not repeat a script from the 1990's. The settlements don't help, but the core issue is that the Palestinians have never decided to end their century-long war on Zionism, and never accepted to accept the existence of a Jewish state alongside them. The fact that even the Palestinians who nominally support the two-state solution, still insist on the ""full right of return"", to create a Palestinian-majority, Palestinian-ruled state of Israel, alongside a pure Arab ethnostate of Palestine. The first step, is the Palestinians committing to the Einat Wilf declaration, that they are Palestinians in Palestine, they're not refugees or eligible to return to Israel, and that they accept a Jewish Israeli state, alongside an Arab Palestinian one. And of course, if that happens, the Israelis should seize on the opportunity and reciprocate, even if it means replacing the current government with a more compatible one.",IsraelPalestine,12/02/2024 12:10,1h4fkct,nidarus,0,4,0,TRUE,1/30/2010 5:10,2426,61,2181,190030,194698,13,"Let me preface this by saying that my father is ethnically Jewish, and that roughly ten years ago, I studied Hebrew, read (bits of) the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, as well as Jewish writers such as Josephus and Philo Judaeus, with the plan being for me ultimately to convert to Judaism.

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well.

The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.

I’d still like to believe that but much of what has happened in response to this conflict makes that hard. I’m not getting why,if not for antisemitism, are people are so anti-Zionist and why this conflict is so focussed on. I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement? 

And this isn’t the only conflict in the world. It’s not even the largest by people killed or involved. Here is a map that shows all current conflicts. https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker

Why is the focus on Ukraine minimal when it is one if the most despicable wars ever with the potential of the collapse of Western society? 

People deny this is rooted in antisemitism and I want to believe they’re accurate, but in our community, we just can’t come up with any other reason! So if you are Anti-Zionist, what do you think Zionism is? Do we not have the right to self define? Is the definition offensive to you?

**I am asking because my best friend is Palestinian from Jaffa. Recently, we went to a Palestinian restaurant in the USA with her mom. The decorations in the restaurant focused a lot on Israeli oppression and Palestinian resistance. My friend looked uncomfortable and sad. Later, she told me that resistance is important, but it makes her sad that Palestinian culture is now often defined by its connection to Israel more than anything else. She said that Palestinian culture is so much bigger than that.**

**This made me wonder how other Palestinians (living in Palestine/Israel or outside) feel about how Palestinian culture is seen in the world these days. I would love to hear any feelings and thoughts if you are comfortable sharing...**

Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence, who prevented holocaust survivors from seeking refuge in the British Mandate.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted. Please research the ways Palestinians are treated in Lebanon and Jordan, where they are banned from certain professions, from owning property, from having full citizenship, all so they can be used as a political tool to put pressure on Israel.

I’d still like to believe that but much of what has happened in response to this conflict makes that hard. I’m not getting why,if not for antisemitism, are people are so anti-Zionist and why this conflict is so focussed on. I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement? 

And this isn’t the only conflict in the world. It’s not even the largest by people killed or involved. Here is a map that shows all current conflicts. https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker

In any case, Israel has kept their word about all hostage exchanges in the current day and going back years into the past. There have been hostages exchanged for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel before. Why would it be any different with money? 

If they honestly just weren’t sure that Israel would keep their promise then they could try it out. Give back one hostage. Get the money. Then go to the next one. They don’t have to give everyone back at once. 

The reason that they don’t want to accept the money is because they don’t actually want funds to feed and care for their civilians. They have received countless millions in the past and instead of investing in infrastructure and in their people they spent the money on weapons and the massive system of underground tunnels. Hamas wants their people suffering because its helps to get the world on their side. This is also why they surround things Israel would like to target with civilians. This is why they try to block their civilians from evacuating areas that Israel warned they would be targeting.

Yet, despite this significant offer, none of the 101 hostages have been successfully returned so far. What makes this even more perplexing is the clear evidence that some of the hostages are being sheltered and cared for by Gazan civilians. This raises an unsettling question: how could a father, who has the chance to secure safety, a better future for his family, and an improved quality of life, choose instead to keep a hostage? 

This decision defies logic on multiple levels. It is not just about the economic or material benefits offered by Israel. The offer promises a lifeline, an escape from the hardships and dangers that many Gazan civilians face daily. Accepting such an offer would theoretically guarantee safety from ongoing conflicts, access to better healthcare and education, and a future of stability. Yet, the fact that no one has taken advantage of this opportunity suggests a deeper, more troubling dynamic at play.

It leads me to consider whether hatred toward Israelis surpasses the love for their own children among some Gazans. Is the hostility so deeply ingrained that it eclipses even the instinctual drive to protect and provide for their families? This possibility is deeply unsettling, as it speaks to a cycle of animosity that overrides self-preservation and the pursuit of a better life.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

Israelis often feel they're unfairly targeted for their nationality and that you if you're Israeli or shows any Israeli culture literally anywhere, you'll receive harsh criticism, if not outright hatred.



This is absolutely the case. You simply can't even mention Israel at all, or talk about the cutlure of Tel Aviv or Haifa today, without people directly saying that it's all Palestinian land, you're all settlers, etc. It's simply impossible to just share you like Hebrew music or modern Israeli couscous without people bringing up the conflict.


This is especially the case if you're in any context with many people from Middle Eastern, Arab or Muslim people. They aren't known to tolerate people saying they're Israeli.


The same is also true for left-wing activist groups in the West.



It feels really unfair because most other nationalities and ethnicities can simply talk about where they're from without getting an automatic harsh reaction, but they can't. Their very existance is political.



While it's often definitely very related to antisemitism, it's also often motivated by something else, namely, geopolitics and ethnic conflicts.



The thing is, the legitimacy of the State of Israel is not uninamous. Some believe it's not a legitimate state, and it's all an illegal occupation of the sovereign country of Palestine.


You might personally believe it's outrageous and unacceptable, but it's most likely because you grew up in a context where Israel being a state isn't questioned.


But in the Arab World for example most people don't believe Israel is a legitimate state.


But the thing is, the same treatment is often given to people from other disputed or unrecognised regions or states.



For example Abkhazia, it's a partially recognised state in the Caucasus claimed by Georgia as its autonomous region. It declared secession after an ethnic conflict in the 1990s and most of the world doesn't recognise it, except for Russia.


The thing is that the same applies to Abkhazians and any, even apolitical posts about Abkhazia.



If you want to share anything happening in modern day Abkhazia, for example about some caves found there, or about their recent protests there, or their food and culture, people would inevitably bring up Georgia.





And in fact, the vast majority of people will be on the opposing side, and they won't have many people defending them and if not being on their side, at least trying to bring up nuance.


[Ironically, this happens even for people who are themselves citizens of an unrecognised state.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kosovo/comments/1eoar1h/i_want_to_relocate_from_abkhazia_to_kosovo_how_is/)


The problem isn't just that Georgians outnumber Abkhazians (like the Arab World outnumbers Israel) but rather that people that are not directly tied to the conflict will automatically take a side because this will be seen as a proxy for their politics in general. For Abkhazia, the major Western powers (for example the EU) massively support Georgia, and people in the West are against Abkhazia because they believe backing Georgia means being against Russian imperialism.


I've seen it myself, any people who try to bring any nuance to this conflict, even if they're Abkhazian themselves, are accused of being pro Russian. Same with Israel too, in some cases.


Meanwhile, for Israel, left-wing activist circles believe that Israel is a settler colonial state, therefore backing Palestinians at all times is backing decolonization.



Both of these conflicts are actually much more complex than this simplistic narrative, but people don't actually try to learn that, they take sides automatically based on some narrative they've heard.


But because of this politization, merely saying you live in Israel or Abkhazia or are Abkhazian, as opposed to Georgian for example, is seen as itself a political statement.


If you live in Sukhumi and you say you're Abkhazian, even though it's the norm in your society, and saying you're Georgian is as unacceptable as a Georgian saying they're Russian, you're told that if you want to participate in the modern world, you should say you're Georgian and live in Georgia. The same is true for Israelis. If you live in Jaffa, how can you say it's an Israeli city? And use this symbol 🇮🇱 which is very political? For the Palestinians whose family is from there, it can be offensive.


And yes, you can be seen as a settler because the state you live in is seen as illegitimate.


This is very problematic.




All that often also happens with people from other disputed regions or states (Kosovo, South Ossetia, Northern Cyprus, Crimea, Kashmir, Tibet, etc).



Personally, I feel like in both cases, this approach doesn't necessarily help people to actually resolve ethnic conflicts. Instead of actually trying to build ties and create a solution that'll satisfy everyone, for example by strengthening the opposition. For example pro Palestinian people could've supported the Israeli opposition and the Israeli diaspora itself could've been supportive of a Palestinian state and even a right of return. But no, instead, we obsess over the legality of borders and the legitimacy of states, which means people on the opposite side see us as an existential threat to their existance.









We say we're modern people but in reality we're still tribal creatures, unfortunately.


Geopolitics, governments, state sovereignity and independence is unfortunately very ingrained in all of us and it's arguably like modern day religion.



It's sad to fight against this because this doesn't become merely discrimination, but also a geopolitical opinion opposing this state, and it's very hard to draw the lines over what's acceptable and what's not. But often times, people who say that racism is unacceptable still say unacceptable things merely because of the nationality of the person.



**However, unfortunately, this is something that's very common right now and is seen as the natural thing to do. So I've created this post to try to explain the logic of those that oppose anyone automatically if they say they're ""Israelis"", to understand their motivations, to know how to possibly fight against them, and also to oppose similar situations in the Western World, where entire identities become politicised.**



In my opinion, we should really deconstruct the idea of states and nations if we actually want to achieve world peace, or at least strive towards it.


I think we should be much more mindful about how national identities shape our worldview and how people from ""disputed regions"" might still be first and foremost people and we should try to look beyond merely borders and nations, be it recognised or not.




I also believe we shouldn't see the world merely through a lense of ""states"" and ""nations"". I believe the videos and maps about ""X fun thing in every country in the world"" (for example food, music, architecture, fun facts, etc) should also include people without states or with disputed states and that it shouldn't be seen as inherently political. So yeah, including Israel, Palestine, Abkhazia, Tibet, Hawaii, Ingushetia, Tamil Nadu, Jewish diaspora etc. If our world wasn't so fixated on ""countries"", aka, sovereign states, these things would've been much less problematic.

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office.

On the first day of Israel claiming sovereignty, it was the Arab league that attacked, and failed. As there has been no official cessation of hostilities since then, it's been an ongoing war for 80 years, and thus thus it should be Arab who foots the bill being the instigator.",IsraelPalestine,12/02/2024 23:51,1h50qrx,OddShelter5543,0,1,0,TRUE,6/16/2024 19:46,0,0,1,2215,2216,19,"During World War II, several Arab leaders, including the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Amin al-Husseini, forged strong ties with Nazi Germany. Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.

But are there other reasons?  Maybe some scriptural basis for needing to be majority Jewish?  I can't find any so far.  There's certainly a scriptural basis for the idea of Jews having a *connection* to the land of Israel, but there's nothing I've found in the Jewish tradition/scriture that says Jews need to be in the majority. 

Or maybe something totally different? I know Israel was *planned* as a Jewish state by the UN partition plan, same as Pakistan was planned as a Muslim state.. 

I'm not challenging the idea that it should be majority Jewish.

So I don't see anything strange about Jews being the majority in Israel.) 

So I'm not asking ""why"" as a way to criticize Israel.  I'm searching for all the possible reasons why any stakeholders want to keep it majority Jewish.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

3314,lzzuu8h,22,"So here's my take for those responding with ""Zionism is an ethno-state movement, that's evil"":

I can acknowledge ""ethnostates"" (really ethno-nationalist states since few are actually *ethno-states*) are ""bad"", in that they were often created at the expense of other people in the area. This goes for most every ethno-nationalist state I can think of.

That said, the alternative isn't much better. Forcing people in 1919 to live in a single state, under the premise that they have to get along, treat minorities with dignity, grant equal rights to all, in law and practice, and wouldn't all just immediately start fighting once the power that forced them to live together leaves, is I would say nearly impossible, and very unlikely.

Not only that, but blaming modern ethno-nationalist states for all the world's wrongs, fails to understand why ethno-nationalist states and movements rise in the first place... It's due to a failure of different groups of people to get along in the first place, period. India and Pakistan used to be one ""country"" under the British, but most people don't think of that as a good thing, nor was it very ""free"" like it is today... Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and Israel-Palestine used to be united under the Ottoman Empire, but Arabs certainly weren't seen as equals to say a Ottoman Turk living in Anatolia, and the Ottomans treatment of Israel-Palestine was that of mostly negligence and an after-thought. And Jews and Christians were seen even further below them, and designated as second-class citizens by law for most of all of history.

So what would the alternative be in 1919, Jews and Christians in the region continue to live as second-class citizens under a new Arab state? And to be clear I don't mean as Dhimmi's, as that was abolished in the 1830s, but I mean through other discriminatory means, or in practice? Because that's what you get when you try to force people, who aren't ready, to live together- oppressive empires artificially forcing people to live together by conquest.

I think many people make the mistake of looking at history in a 21st century lense and applying our standards and understanding of ""look, we're mostly getting along now over here (after 100 years later)"" with ""why coudn't we do that back then?""... They couldn't.

Basically, imagine if you were talking to a Chinese or even American during WW2, about the horrible suffering of Japanese civilians. That included the killing of about *ten times* more civilians, including with atomic bombs, and being starved to death. It's not that Japanese children are less worthy of life, or their suffering is meaningless. But ultimately, that's war, that the Japanese have started. And if you were saying that while WW2 was still raging, you'd be seen as implying that the war itself is immoral, and the Americans and Chinese should be ashamed for not letting the Japanese win.

And note, that the Japanese, for all of their faults, didn't build their entire war machine under and inside civilian homes. The US could've theoretically avoided many of the bombings. This just isn't the case with Hamas and Israel. I simply don't see any way for Israel to try to defeat Hamas, without destroying most of Gaza, and killing lots of Gazans. Hamas invested billions into that being the case. As such, while feeling for the children of Gaza is of course noble, I'm not sure what policies you expect the Israelis to support. The usual argument that follows this, is that because the Gazan are suffering, the Israelis must surrender, comply with Hamas' demands, and brace for the next Oct. 7th. Which is pretty unreasonable.

Ultimately, it's okay to hold several thoughts at once. Many Gazan civilians are dying or suffering. This is a direct result of a war that their government started. This is a direct result of the Gazan government intentionally trying to increase their civilian casualties, by hiding behind their civilians and refusing to build a single bomb shelter. This is the direct result of their government refusing to surrender, to this day - which somehow nobody expects it to. You could also argue that it's a result of Israel not surrendering - but ultimately, they didn't choose this war, didn't choose how this war would be waged, and have a completely valid goal. With that said, we can still feel bad for the Gazan children, in the way we can still cry while watching the Grave of the Fireflies, without thinking the Japanese were the good guys of WW2. We can still acknowledge the Israeli war crimes, from looting and unnecessary property destruction, to abuse and murder of prisoners, and use of individual human shields, without saying that ultimately, it means their war against Hamas is an unjustified crime.

He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

2991,m00era8,15,"&gt;But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. 

The Palestinian nationalist story is incredibly problematic, in every conceivable way.

**Its goal** is first and foremost, to make sure the Jews don't have a state in what they see as Arab lands. The Jews not having a state, is more important than the Palestinians themselves having a state. Furthermore, they don't believe the Jews should just become Palestinians - they believe they should be expelled, murdered, or enslaved. Palestinians hate the idea of a single democratic state, at least as much as the Israelis do, with consistent &lt;10% support. And while they've sold some of the more unhinged Westerners on this horrible idea, I don't see Jimmy Fallon openly saying Israel should be eliminated, and the Jews should be ethnically cleansed. 

**The nature** of the Palestinian nationalist movement is, of course, one of a very exclusionary and racist ethno-nationalist movement, that seeks to create an actual Palestinian Arab ethnostate. The Palestinian constitution and national charter define Palestinian as Arab, and don't really contemplate a non-Arab being a legitimate Palestinian at all. And indeed, while there are two million Palestinian Arab Israelis, even the most moderate Palestinians demand that every single Israeli Jew (i.e. essentially every Jew, period) that lives in Palestine must be expelled for Palestine to be ""free"". Even the chant ""from the river to the sea"" in the original Arabic generally doesn't end with Palestine being ""free"" but it being ""Arab"" (and occasionally ""Islamic""). That's obviously an issue if you want to frame your resistance to Jewish national self-determination as mere opposition against ethno-nationalism.

**They consistently started the violence** in this conflict. They've started the violent conflict in the 1920's. They rejected the peaceful partition plan, that the Zionists accepted in the 1940's, and started the civil war that would lead to the Nakba. And then, continued to massacre Israelis, for the goal of no more Israel. The Palestinian story is trying to destroy (or prevent) Israel and expel the Jews, losing, and framing themselves as victims of a great injustice. 

**They've been committing horrific atrocities since day one**. From the sacking of the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem in the Nebi Musa riots in 1920, to going door to door in the ancient Jewish community of Hebron, and massacring, looting, raping, and dismembering the families inside with axes, while chanting ""Palestine is our land, the Jews are our dogs"". This was before any comparable violence from the Jews against Arabs, and directly led to the creation of the Jewish terrorists. Since then, the Palestinian military strategy has been laser-focused on committing atrocities against civilians, like taking over a school and executing the kids, infiltrating the Olympic games and torture-murdering Israeli athletes, blowing up cafes, night clubs and pizza parlors, breaking into homes and decapitating babies in their sleep, and more. And that's before we even got to Oct. 7th, which fits the legal definition of genocide far more than anything Israel has done since.

**The people who lead them are absolutely horrible.** You can have all kinds of opinion about Ben Gurion, but his Palestinian contemporary, Amin Husseini, was literally a Nazi ally, an avid supporter of the Holocaust, who toured concentration camps and was ""positively impressed"", who wrote pro-genocide propaganda for Bosnian SS troops, about how the Jews are the enemies of Islam and humanity. Arafat was, objectively, an international terrorist leader, responsible for various PLO atrocities in the region and the world, before he was whitewashed as a ""peacemaker"". Abbas, the most moderate of all, is still a deeply unpopular, deeply corrupt, and deeply antisemitic holocaust denier. While the Hamas leadership are fanatical, genocidal racists, whose motto is ""the Palestinians love death the way the Israelis love life"", and make even Smotrich and Ben Gvir, let alone Netanyahu, look like reasonable moderates. Palestinians occasionally like to talk about how Israel elected two former terrorists - *every single* Palestinian leader are either active or former terrorists, and every meaningful Palestinian party is either an active, semi-retired or former terrorist group. There's a reason why even today, there's no Palestinian Zelensky. And it's not just because Zelensky is such an extraordinary figure. 

**Their historical and modern allies are awful**. Since the beginning, the Palestinians have allied themselves with the worst elements of the international community. Originally, as I mentioned, it was the Nazis. Then, it was the Soviets and the Pan-Arabists. Then, the Sunni Islamists. Now, Iran and its Axis. Along the way, they supported occasional baddies Saddam Hussein, North Korea, Cuba, Putin's Russia and so on. Right now, anyone who supports their goal, has to align with people who wave the flag of the Houthis, that says ""curse on the Jews"" on it. People who hate America, hate any Western country they live in, and would much rather burn their country's flag than to wave it. This obviously puts a natural cap on their mainstream success.

**The modern Palestinians society have problematic values**. We can talk about the issues with Israeli society day and night, but on the Palestinian side, you have [93% who believe](https://global100.adl.org/country/west-bank-and-gaza/2014) in classic antisemitic tropes like Jews controlling the world's banks, politics and media. Overwhelming Holocaust denial (around 82% of the ones who've heard of the Holocaust say it's a hoax or vastly exaggerated), where *not* denying the Holocaust is a controversial, fringe opinion.  [89% support](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-overview/) Shari'a as law of the land, 76% for corporal punishment like cutting off hands of thieves, 87% who believe a wife should obey her husband, 84% believe in stoning as punishment for adultery. And more ""mainstream"" conservative views, like 89% believing homosexuality is morally unacceptable (only 1% believing it's morally acceptable), overwhelming rejection of premarital sex, abortion, and so on. While, again, Israelis aren't exactly Western European in their views either (they're closer to Eastern European nations like Poland), they're far closer to the Western liberals who support the Palestinians, than anyone else in the Middle East. And certainly the Palestinians, who are conservative (to put it mildly) even compared to the Middle East. And don't share a single value with the Westerners who support them, except hatred for the West.

**The Palestinian Arab identity is problematic for their narrative**. The post-colonial narrative is hard for Palestinians, since the Jews have at least as much of a claim to be the ""Native Americans"" in this story.  To put it simply, the Arab identity and culture are as indigenous to the Land of Israel as the British Christian identity and culture are to the Americas, which is not the case for the Jews. The idea of a Palestinian People exists since the 19th-20th century, largely as a reaction to Zionism, while the Jewish identity stretches back into antiquity. If you dig down in Israel, you'll find Jewish artifacts, thousands of years before any Palestinian, or even Arab ones. While one of their treasured goals, to maintain Muslim supremacy over the Jewish holiest places, simply cannot be framed as ""anti-colonial"". This leads to the Palestinian nationalists leaning into their Canaanite genetic ancestors (that they don't even know what nations they belonged to, let alone have any interest in reviving their identity or culture), and more or less explicit racial supremacy. With a large focus on the Jews' incorrect race, incorrect skin color, the discredited Khazar theory and so on.

If the Palestinian cause was so inherently noble, there wouldn't be a **need to lie about it**. Or to try to pretend it doesn't exist. Including: lying about the Palestinian goals as merely wanting a civic nationalist state or a two-state solution. Lying about the Palestinian nationalist movement, and saying it's a less ethnocratic alternative to Zionism. Lying that the Jews have started the violent conflict. Lying about the Jewish connection to the land, and equally, about the supposedly ancient history of the Palestinian people. Minimizing and trying to ignore the existence of the horrible, bloodthirsty Palestinian leadership, and the horrible views of the Palestinians in Palestine. While at the same time trying to highlight the far milder problems with Israeli leadership and society. And indeed, pretending that in the war between Israel and Hamas, Hamas basically doesn't exist at all. 

The fact is, the fact that the Palestinians managed to claw out of ignobility, even after committing the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, while committing ISIS-level atrocities and kidnapping literal toddlers, and still become the darlings of a group of Westerners that they hate, and oppose on (nearly) every ideological level, isn't a result of them having an inherently better story. It's a result of their Qatari, Iranian, and to some extent Russian allies investing billions of dollars, untold man-hours, and decades of work in NGOs, academia, and the UN. Both as part of the Oct. 7th media blitz, and the general anti-Israeli campaign since the 1960's. While Israel, that frankly has an easier story to sell here, simply decided to not show up to that battlefield at all. But like everything, nothing is irreparable. The Palestinians were once pariahs.

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

https://x.com/MTVEnglishNews/status/1863159187968045521   

It seems fighting is still continuing by Israelis against Hezbollah.   

As far as I know, Israel couldn't negotiate a deal to end hezbollah but instead negotiated a deal to only move hezbollah north of the litani and not allow new weapon supplies, but it did not mention any ideas of disarming hezbollah north of the litani. This was the ceasefire terms agreed upon both sides.   

While it would have been better for Lebanese and for Israelis to have a deal ensuring disarming Hezbollah as a foreign backed militia in Lebanon, this was not the deal Israel was achieved.   

Ever since the ceasefire, Israel has continued attacks on what it claims are hezbollah targets, but they are doing so even north of the Litani river where the deal that both sides agreed to did not mention that hezbollah can't operate there.   

I'm afraid this will do nothing but put anyone who opposes hezbollah from the Lebanese side in a bad position because this would only prove that you can't trust israeli ceasefires and terms. This will only give hezbollah more reasons to remain legitimate and will dismiss any Lebanese efforts to take control.     
   
   
EDIT: From one of the replies:

[link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/israel-hezbollah-syria-ceasefire-gaza-world-central-kitchen/)

&gt; An Israeli airstrike on a car in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed five people, including employees of World Central Kitchen. The charity said it was ""urgently seeking more details"" after Israel's military said it targeted a WCK worker who was part of the Hamas attack that sparked the war.

&gt; Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites along Syria's border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said Saturday, testing a fragile, days-old ceasefire that has seen continued sporadic fire.

&gt; The military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria into Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect, which the military said was a violation of its terms. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities or Hezbollah.

Hezbollah smuggling arms is a clear violation of ceasefire terms

However, that does not explain why Israel has bombed a member of the Lebanese Army in the far north. They're also destroying random buildings in the south, that was not part of any agreement.

What they do not realise is that the opposite is true. Not only is defeat possible, but in Gaza, they are winning.

For one, countless anaylsts, including those in Israel have commented that Israel has already lost the war. And that it cannot beat Hamas or the Palestinian Joint-Operations Room.

[As early as last month,](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/israel-losing-netanyahu-wont-back-down-his-war-aims) the British defence think tank reported that:

&gt; Israel is not achieving its war aims against Hamas. First, it has only obtained a handful of the hostages. Some have been killed; the fates of many others are still unknown.

Second, Hamas has not been destroyed. Destruction of a terrorist organisation is difficult to measure. Some point to leadership decapitation. However, as Jenna Jordan has pointed out, attriting terrorist leaders seldom brings about their organisations’ collapse. Factors such as popular support, ideology and organisational structure play bigger roles in deciding these groups’ fates. Another measure used to determine if a terrorist group has been destroyed is if its territorial sphere has been reduced or removed. Israel has failed to deprive Hamas of the territory it governed prior to the war. Hamas has been battered in Gaza, but it is still a political force to be reckoned with. Unaffiliated Palestinian clans have refused to join in a post-war reconstruction effort for fear of retaliation by Hamas. Third, Israel has not been able to secure its borders. While it has regained control over some border crossings, the underground infrastructure that has allowed Hamas to engage in smuggling weapons and carrying out attacks is still in place.

[Analdou Agency reported that a former Mossad chief had stated that Israel was unequovically losing the war in Gaza.](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-on-losing-end-in-gaza-war-former-mossad-deputy-chief/3223179). Even Zionist publishers like [JP reported this](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-803955).

[As CNN has reported, Hamas has remained wholly combat effective.](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/08/middleeast/gaza-israel-hamas-battalions-invs-intl/). This is a pattern that staretd early in the war. By December, the IDF was declaring most Hamas batallions to have been dismantled.

This was quickly revealed to be a propaganda lie. As in early 2024, reports emerged that Hamas had begun rehabilitating its batallions in North Gaza. Reports from the Neo-Conservative think tank isw argued that as much as 80% of Hamas' fighting strength was restored. 

According to the isw's report on MArch 27th, they argue that this means Palestinian fighters ""retain  significant degree of combat effectiveness in the area, despite continued Israeli clearing efforts around Gaza City."" and that ""The return of Israeli forces to [Zaytoun] suggests that Palestinian militias continue to operate there similar to how these militias still have a presence in other portions of the northern Gaza Strip.""

We can also check pretty much every battle in Gaza to see how this is true.

The first battle in Gaza was the battle of Beit Hanoun. Despite IDF claims, they never occupied the city. And the battle is considered as having ended in a Palestinian victory. The isw reported that when the IDF left in December, the P-JOR continued effective control over Beit Hanoun. Beit Hanoun was used as a base to attack the IDF and send rockets into Israel, demonstrating that teh IDF had failed to defeat the JOR in Beit Hanoun.

Then we have the First Battle of Jabalia. As the isw reported, Hamas retained control of Jabalia after Israel withdrew in May. 

&gt; ""These points taken together reflect the degree to which Hamas and other Palestinian militias remain combat effective in and around Jabalia. Hamas and the other militias will almost certainly resume their efforts to reconstitute there as the IDF units have left.""

Then we have the Battle of Shuja'iyya. Though the IDF declared victory here, heavy casualties forced them to withdraw and as al-Jazeera reported, Palestinians retained control of the city. Further evidence of Palestinain control is that several months later, the IDF returned to the region to try and wrestle control away from the JOR.

This 2nd battle was just as disastrous for the IDF. After retreating in July, Hamas and the PIJ retained dominance in the city. Again, al-Jazeera reported how this had occured. But not stopping there, when the IDF withdrew in videos from the area one could see Palestinian militants with guns in their hands standing around in broad daylight. Alongside this, government officials working for the P-JOR immediately remerged in the city, as if they had never left, and reasserted doubly Palestinian control in the region.

Then we have the siege of Khan Yunis. The first Israeli assualt ended in abject failure. so great was the routing of the IDF they withdrew from all of southern Gaza. Khan Yunis itself remained under the control of the Joint Operations Room. Again, as reported by the isw. The 2nd and 3rd battles ended in much the same way and in far shorter timespans.

Then comes al-Qarara. By all acounts, a Palestinian victory.The isw reported that Israel was defeated in al-Qarara. They had failed to achieve any of their aims. P-JOR remained in control. No high ranking militants were found or killed, and accordinng to anaylsts, Hamas remained combat effective in the region.

This is how every battle that has ended thus far has gone. Israel went in, killed civilians for a few weeks. Ran into resistance, tried to fight back, upon seeing heavy casualties retreated with Palestine still in control.

This is not what victory looks like. Israel is, by all measures losing.","The evidence that Hamas is in fact, beating the IDF in Gaza",0.18,0,0,11/30/2024 16:33,0,Neutral

Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

What they do not realise is that the opposite is true. Not only is defeat possible, but in Gaza, they are winning.

For one, countless anaylsts, including those in Israel have commented that Israel has already lost the war. And that it cannot beat Hamas or the Palestinian Joint-Operations Room.

[As early as last month,](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/israel-losing-netanyahu-wont-back-down-his-war-aims) the British defence think tank reported that:

&gt; Israel is not achieving its war aims against Hamas. First, it has only obtained a handful of the hostages. Some have been killed; the fates of many others are still unknown.

Second, Hamas has not been destroyed. Destruction of a terrorist organisation is difficult to measure. Some point to leadership decapitation. However, as Jenna Jordan has pointed out, attriting terrorist leaders seldom brings about their organisations’ collapse. Factors such as popular support, ideology and organisational structure play bigger roles in deciding these groups’ fates. Another measure used to determine if a terrorist group has been destroyed is if its territorial sphere has been reduced or removed. Israel has failed to deprive Hamas of the territory it governed prior to the war. Hamas has been battered in Gaza, but it is still a political force to be reckoned with. Unaffiliated Palestinian clans have refused to join in a post-war reconstruction effort for fear of retaliation by Hamas. Third, Israel has not been able to secure its borders. While it has regained control over some border crossings, the underground infrastructure that has allowed Hamas to engage in smuggling weapons and carrying out attacks is still in place.

[Analdou Agency reported that a former Mossad chief had stated that Israel was unequovically losing the war in Gaza.](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-on-losing-end-in-gaza-war-former-mossad-deputy-chief/3223179). Even Zionist publishers like [JP reported this](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-803955).

[As CNN has reported, Hamas has remained wholly combat effective.](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/08/middleeast/gaza-israel-hamas-battalions-invs-intl/). This is a pattern that staretd early in the war. By December, the IDF was declaring most Hamas batallions to have been dismantled.

This was quickly revealed to be a propaganda lie. As in early 2024, reports emerged that Hamas had begun rehabilitating its batallions in North Gaza. Reports from the Neo-Conservative think tank isw argued that as much as 80% of Hamas' fighting strength was restored. 

According to the isw's report on MArch 27th, they argue that this means Palestinian fighters ""retain  significant degree of combat effectiveness in the area, despite continued Israeli clearing efforts around Gaza City."" and that ""The return of Israeli forces to [Zaytoun] suggests that Palestinian militias continue to operate there similar to how these militias still have a presence in other portions of the northern Gaza Strip.""

We can also check pretty much every battle in Gaza to see how this is true.

The first battle in Gaza was the battle of Beit Hanoun. Despite IDF claims, they never occupied the city. And the battle is considered as having ended in a Palestinian victory. The isw reported that when the IDF left in December, the P-JOR continued effective control over Beit Hanoun. Beit Hanoun was used as a base to attack the IDF and send rockets into Israel, demonstrating that teh IDF had failed to defeat the JOR in Beit Hanoun.

Then we have the First Battle of Jabalia. As the isw reported, Hamas retained control of Jabalia after Israel withdrew in May. 

&gt; ""These points taken together reflect the degree to which Hamas and other Palestinian militias remain combat effective in and around Jabalia. Hamas and the other militias will almost certainly resume their efforts to reconstitute there as the IDF units have left.""

Then we have the Battle of Shuja'iyya. Though the IDF declared victory here, heavy casualties forced them to withdraw and as al-Jazeera reported, Palestinians retained control of the city. Further evidence of Palestinain control is that several months later, the IDF returned to the region to try and wrestle control away from the JOR.

This 2nd battle was just as disastrous for the IDF. After retreating in July, Hamas and the PIJ retained dominance in the city. Again, al-Jazeera reported how this had occured. But not stopping there, when the IDF withdrew in videos from the area one could see Palestinian militants with guns in their hands standing around in broad daylight. Alongside this, government officials working for the P-JOR immediately remerged in the city, as if they had never left, and reasserted doubly Palestinian control in the region.

Then we have the siege of Khan Yunis. The first Israeli assualt ended in abject failure. so great was the routing of the IDF they withdrew from all of southern Gaza. Khan Yunis itself remained under the control of the Joint Operations Room. Again, as reported by the isw. The 2nd and 3rd battles ended in much the same way and in far shorter timespans.

Then comes al-Qarara. By all acounts, a Palestinian victory.The isw reported that Israel was defeated in al-Qarara. They had failed to achieve any of their aims. P-JOR remained in control. No high ranking militants were found or killed, and accordinng to anaylsts, Hamas remained combat effective in the region.

This is how every battle that has ended thus far has gone. Israel went in, killed civilians for a few weeks. Ran into resistance, tried to fight back, upon seeing heavy casualties retreated with Palestine still in control.

This is not what victory looks like. Israel is, by all measures losing.","The evidence that Hamas is in fact, beating the IDF in Gaza",0.18,0,0,11/30/2024 16:33,1,Pro-Israel

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.",It's Barack Obama's fault that the Peace Process collapsed. ,0.41,0,0,12/02/2024 08:35,0,Neutral

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas.

He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces.

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that.

I know the general idea was to create a place where Jews would be safe, and I suppose that's the main reason to keep a Jewish majority. 

But are there other reasons?  Maybe some scriptural basis for needing to be majority Jewish?  I can't find any so far.  There's certainly a scriptural basis for the idea of Jews having a *connection* to the land of Israel, but there's nothing I've found in the Jewish tradition/scriture that says Jews need to be in the majority. 

Or maybe something totally different? I know Israel was *planned* as a Jewish state by the UN partition plan, same as Pakistan was planned as a Muslim state.. 

I'm not challenging the idea that it should be majority Jewish. (There's basically no such thing as a state whose native ethnic people has not remained in the majority -- France, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Germany, especially Japan, etc., all remain something like 85%-95% ethnically homogeneous.  So I don't see anything strange about Jews being the majority in Israel.) 

So I'm not asking ""why"" as a way to criticize Israel.  I'm searching for all the possible reasons why any stakeholders want to keep it majority Jewish.

I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement? 

And this isn’t the only conflict in the world. It’s not even the largest by people killed or involved. Here is a map that shows all current conflicts. https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker

I know the general idea was to create a place where Jews would be safe, and I suppose that's the main reason to keep a Jewish majority. 

But are there other reasons?  Maybe some scriptural basis for needing to be majority Jewish?  I can't find any so far.  There's certainly a scriptural basis for the idea of Jews having a *connection* to the land of Israel, but there's nothing I've found in the Jewish tradition/scriture that says Jews need to be in the majority. 

Or maybe something totally different? I know Israel was *planned* as a Jewish state by the UN partition plan, same as Pakistan was planned as a Muslim state.. 

I'm not challenging the idea that it should be majority Jewish. (There's basically no such thing as a state whose native ethnic people has not remained in the majority -- France, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Germany, especially Japan, etc., all remain something like 85%-95% ethnically homogeneous.  So I don't see anything strange about Jews being the majority in Israel.) 

So I'm not asking ""why"" as a way to criticize Israel.  I'm searching for all the possible reasons why any stakeholders want to keep it majority Jewish.

I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

People deny this is rooted in antisemitism and I want to believe they’re accurate, but in our community, we just can’t come up with any other reason!

To re-start the Peace Process, Netanyahu accepted a 2 state solution in Bar Ilan and later halted settlement construction, which damaged him in his Political Base

[https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna34151442](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna34151442)

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.",It's Barack Obama's fault that the Peace Process collapsed. ,0.41,0,0,12/02/2024 08:35,1,Pro-Israel

Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence, who prevented holocaust survivors from seeking refuge in the British Mandate.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted. Please research the ways Palestinians are treated in Lebanon and Jordan, where they are banned from certain professions, from owning property, from having full citizenship, all so they can be used as a political tool to put pressure on Israel.

If you think Gaza belongs to you, your property, you would not have flatten much of Gaza. I still think the current top Israeli leadership also doesnt want to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip.

1. Ben-Gurion and early zionists may have commented on Greater Israel. But time has changed, the current top leadership is no Ben-Gurion. Similarly, Trump is no Biden. The government policies will change depending on the leader and changes with the time.

2. Daniella Weiss, Ben-Gvir, Smotrich and other extreme right wings may be salivating at the idea of re-establishing Gush Katif settlements (formerly near Khan Yunis) in the southern Gaza Strip. But none of them were part of the former top Israeli war cabinet, and even currently they do not direct or lead the war. They may try, but this is not official government policy. 

I am trying to explain that is/was not the intention of Israel/IDF to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip. It’s kinda an ancient war maxime (idk what is it called), but you dont destroy the land/ all the buildings if you want to conquer itand considered that land belongs to you.

3. During WW2, Germany didnt destroy Paris. They tried when they were losing and evacuating, but not at the start. They wanted Paris to be intact. And you would too if you are conquering Paris. There is a suggestion (some might dispute it) that the German leader who cannot be named during WW2, did not REALLY wanted to conquer Britain. After defeating France, Germany thought Britain would make peace. There were lots of destruction during the Battle of Britain especially London.

4. US dropped nuclear bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, flatten them. US had no intention of permanently conquering Japan. US never saw Japan as part of US land. US wanted to end the war, and thought using nuclear bomb will do that, and it did, Japan surrendered. US was in Japan for a bit to sort things out then quickly handed over to a transitional Japanese government. US had no intention of conquering Japan.

5. US dropped more than 7.5 million tons of bombs in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. US had no intention of permanently conquering Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos. It’s easier to completely destroy something you dont want/need and even easier if you are not the one going to clean up the mess later down the line. See the pattern….Israel has no intention of funding the rebuilding of Gaza with Israeli money. But that doesnt mean Israel will prevent others from funding the rebuilding of Gaza, mainly from donations from USA, Europe, Arab, Muslim countries and rest of international world but not Israel.

6. I dont have the facts, can someone check how was the six days war fought in Jerusalem ? If my theory is correct, my prediction would be, there should be minimal destruction in Jerusalem. Israel wants/wanted Jerusalem, and to be intact, not flatten. See the difference with Gaza Strip. 

7. What is Jerusalem worth ? Saladdin replied Nothing, then said Everything. I am not saying its historically accurate, i wanted to emphasize how people think. Jerusalem is worth nothing and everything. You wont want to destroy something that valuable. 

8. At the beginning of the Ukraine war, did you noticed the Russia’s attack was very tactical and calculated…lets attack the telecommunication system, military bases, military airbase, railway lines etc… I think at this moment, Putin really thought Ukraine was part of Russia, so he wasnt intending to flatten Ukraine. But Putin’s invasion plans didnt go as plan, F£*&amp; it… then Russia started to change tactic and started to obliterate cities like Bahmut, Mariupol, Kharkiv, etc... Well, if Putin cant have Ukraine, nobody else can…. might as well flatten it. 

9. Even if any US states try to secede from USA, the US military is unlikely going to flatten their cities. Because Washington would have concluded that is part of US land, we shouldnt cause that much destruction. Not to mention the bad press, criticism, protests, etc… the people there are American citizens and they might have family and friends in other parts of the USA. If its not US land, well… I can tell you the approach will be very different.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​

https://x.com/MTVEnglishNews/status/1863159187968045521   

It seems fighting is still continuing by Israelis against Hezbollah.   

As far as I know, Israel couldn't negotiate a deal to end hezbollah but instead negotiated a deal to only move hezbollah north of the litani and not allow new weapon supplies, but it did not mention any ideas of disarming hezbollah north of the litani. This was the ceasefire terms agreed upon both sides.   

While it would have been better for Lebanese and for Israelis to have a deal ensuring disarming Hezbollah as a foreign backed militia in Lebanon, this was not the deal Israel was achieved.   

Ever since the ceasefire, Israel has continued attacks on what it claims are hezbollah targets, but they are doing so even north of the Litani river where the deal that both sides agreed to did not mention that hezbollah can't operate there.   

I'm afraid this will do nothing but put anyone who opposes hezbollah from the Lebanese side in a bad position because this would only prove that you can't trust israeli ceasefires and terms. This will only give hezbollah more reasons to remain legitimate and will dismiss any Lebanese efforts to take control.     
   
   
EDIT: From one of the replies:

[link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/israel-hezbollah-syria-ceasefire-gaza-world-central-kitchen/)

&gt; An Israeli airstrike on a car in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed five people, including employees of World Central Kitchen. The charity said it was ""urgently seeking more details"" after Israel's military said it targeted a WCK worker who was part of the Hamas attack that sparked the war.

&gt; Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites along Syria's border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said Saturday, testing a fragile, days-old ceasefire that has seen continued sporadic fire.

&gt; The military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria into Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect, which the military said was a violation of its terms. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities or Hezbollah.

Hezbollah smuggling arms is a clear violation of ceasefire terms

After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things.

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

https://x.com/MTVEnglishNews/status/1863159187968045521   

It seems fighting is still continuing by Israelis against Hezbollah.   

As far as I know, Israel couldn't negotiate a deal to end hezbollah but instead negotiated a deal to only move hezbollah north of the litani and not allow new weapon supplies, but it did not mention any ideas of disarming hezbollah north of the litani. This was the ceasefire terms agreed upon both sides.   

While it would have been better for Lebanese and for Israelis to have a deal ensuring disarming Hezbollah as a foreign backed militia in Lebanon, this was not the deal Israel was achieved.   

Ever since the ceasefire, Israel has continued attacks on what it claims are hezbollah targets, but they are doing so even north of the Litani river where the deal that both sides agreed to did not mention that hezbollah can't operate there.   

I'm afraid this will do nothing but put anyone who opposes hezbollah from the Lebanese side in a bad position because this would only prove that you can't trust israeli ceasefires and terms. This will only give hezbollah more reasons to remain legitimate and will dismiss any Lebanese efforts to take control.     
   
   
EDIT: From one of the replies:

[link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/israel-hezbollah-syria-ceasefire-gaza-world-central-kitchen/)

&gt; An Israeli airstrike on a car in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed five people, including employees of World Central Kitchen. The charity said it was ""urgently seeking more details"" after Israel's military said it targeted a WCK worker who was part of the Hamas attack that sparked the war.

&gt; Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites along Syria's border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said Saturday, testing a fragile, days-old ceasefire that has seen continued sporadic fire.

&gt; The military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria into Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect, which the military said was a violation of its terms. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities or Hezbollah.

Hezbollah smuggling arms is a clear violation of ceasefire terms

However, that does not explain why Israel has bombed a member of the Lebanese Army in the far north. They're also destroying random buildings in the south, that was not part of any agreement.

2844,m00nblp,1,"Unquestionably, not all violence by Israeli is self-defence. The same can be said for every country that has ever existed. No country is a monolith. However, purpotrators of such behavior are not the majority. Israel is a multicultural pluralist democracy governed by coalition governments, and yes, a small minority of those coalitions are far right-wing agetators. 

It is important to understand the context of why multiple coalition governments have chosen to continue the occupation. It is maintained because it is essential. Not because they hope it will crush rebellion. Jihadists are a real and ongoing threat to the existence of all Israeli people. They see no other option but to maintain harsh security measures to counter that very real threat.

Can you honestly say that if you had unsuccessfully tried to negotiate and make peace for decades with a cult dedicated to killing your family, you wouldn't restrain that cults ability to kill your family? 

Israel seeded administration of Gaza in a bid for peace. They agreed to a staged withdrawal of security measures that started with the forced removal of 10 thousand Israeli citizens. That agreement was followed by 147 suicide bombers from Islamic Jihad, Islamic brotherhood, and Hamas. Obviously, the reduction in security was reversed.

Israel issued over 18 thousand daily work permits to Gazans, while Hamas planned for October 7th. Yes, Israel imposes harsh security restrictions on Palestinians, and few people with power chose to use that power for despicable means. That doesn't mean the system is not necessary any more than the abusive prison guard makes the entire corrections  system should be done away with. 

An undeniable truth is that Israel has made peace with every entity that has ever wanted peace with Israel.  Unfortunately, Jihadists don't fit that description and must be treated accordingly.

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior.

The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally .

Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally.

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.",It's Barack Obama's fault that the Peace Process collapsed. ,0.41,0,0,12/02/2024 08:35,0,Neutral

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS.

I’d still like to believe that but much of what has happened in response to this conflict makes that hard. I’m not getting why,if not for antisemitism, are people are so anti-Zionist and why this conflict is so focussed on. I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement? 

And this isn’t the only conflict in the world. It’s not even the largest by people killed or involved. Here is a map that shows all current conflicts. https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker

Why is the focus on Ukraine minimal when it is one if the most despicable wars ever with the potential of the collapse of Western society?

Palestinians are far from the only stateless people, even in this region. It doesn't preclude the druze, armenian, yezidis, bahai, etc from having identities and cultures outside of 'resistance.' Besides, there was a real attempt to give Palestinians a state 30 years ago. This current rejection of a Palestinian state is a response to how poorly the Palestinians acted after the peace process. So if 'resistance' being by far the biggest part of Palestinian culture is directly because of Netanyahu, that begs the question. What was the culture like 20+ years ago and why is none of it really present today?

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

I am referring to the MoH numbers regarding identified bodies which is over 40,000 people. If you go looking for statistical anomalies in a large data set you can find them.

You argue that the death totals in Gaza are exaggerated and then promptly follow that up with an inflated number of deaths during the disgusting Oct 7 attack. 1,139 is not ""around 1,500"".

The land belonged to Britain, Britain would have more knowledge of the territory they were running, but there were a few different proposals put together.


Please re-read the resolution (link at the end, but im sure you'reabke to goodle and read the actual resolution from the UN) each country had 2 months to set up a provisional government and hold elections no later then 2 months after Britain left, which was to be no later then 1st of August 1948. There was no multi year plan and no Arab was to live in Jewish land and no Jew to live in Arab land unless special authorisation was provided by the Mandate or the provisional government. Just like for the countries I mentioned before.


India and Pakistan have animosity between them as do Syria and Lebanon, but they also have ties, those are not black and white, there is a lot of grey as all new countries have.


You talk about colonialism and I can't help but wonder the definition? Are you trying to use the definition from the 1500's? Are you confusing this with Imperialism? Do you think that people under a dictatorship like Russia was (or still is depending on your views) or any of the Middle Eastern Kingdoms had it? Due to that resolution the possibility of self determination for bother Jewish Palestinians and  Arab Palestinians came to be.


Funny you should mention Sicily, have a read about Sicilian history and the Unification of Italy. Or just chat with Italians that will not introduce themselves as Italians but as Napolitans or Sicilians, but that's already really long and off topic.


Ethnic cleansing means something else, it means killing or removing a whole ethnicity the Israelis have not done that or attempted to do that, the Arabs that remained in Israel have become full citizens, they are about 20% of Israel's population, they have changed nationalities, though not ethnicity and some still consider themselves Palestinians. But the Modern Palestinian population has only increased worldwide. The population if Gaza has increased since the war started that does not happen in cases of ethnic cleansing.

I’d still like to believe that but much of what has happened in response to this conflict makes that hard. I’m not getting why,if not for antisemitism, are people are so anti-Zionist and why this conflict is so focussed on. I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement? 

And this isn’t the only conflict in the world. It’s not even the largest by people killed or involved. Here is a map that shows all current conflicts. https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker 

Most I hadn’t even heard of, but why no focus on the conflicts and genocide in Sudan where 25 million people need humanitarian aid and 12 million have been displaced? Why is the focus on Ukraine minimal when it is one if the most despicable wars ever with the potential of the collapse of Western society? 

People deny this is rooted in antisemitism and I want to believe they’re accurate, but in our community, we just can’t come up with any other reason! So if you are Anti-Zionist, what do you think Zionism is? Do we not have the right to self define? Is the definition offensive to you?

If you think Gaza belongs to you, your property, you would not have flatten much of Gaza. I still think the current top Israeli leadership also doesnt want to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip.

1. Ben-Gurion and early zionists may have commented on Greater Israel. But time has changed, the current top leadership is no Ben-Gurion. Similarly, Trump is no Biden. The government policies will change depending on the leader and changes with the time.

2. Daniella Weiss, Ben-Gvir, Smotrich and other extreme right wings may be salivating at the idea of re-establishing Gush Katif settlements (formerly near Khan Yunis) in the southern Gaza Strip. But none of them were part of the former top Israeli war cabinet, and even currently they do not direct or lead the war. They may try, but this is not official government policy. 

I am trying to explain that is/was not the intention of Israel/IDF to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip. It’s kinda an ancient war maxime (idk what is it called), but you dont destroy the land/ all the buildings if you want to conquer itand considered that land belongs to you.

3. During WW2, Germany didnt destroy Paris. They tried when they were losing and evacuating, but not at the start. They wanted Paris to be intact. And you would too if you are conquering Paris. There is a suggestion (some might dispute it) that the German leader who cannot be named during WW2, did not REALLY wanted to conquer Britain. After defeating France, Germany thought Britain would make peace. There were lots of destruction during the Battle of Britain especially London.

4. US dropped nuclear bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, flatten them. US had no intention of permanently conquering Japan. US never saw Japan as part of US land. US wanted to end the war, and thought using nuclear bomb will do that, and it did, Japan surrendered. US was in Japan for a bit to sort things out then quickly handed over to a transitional Japanese government. US had no intention of conquering Japan.

5. US dropped more than 7.5 million tons of bombs in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. US had no intention of permanently conquering Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos. It’s easier to completely destroy something you dont want/need and even easier if you are not the one going to clean up the mess later down the line. See the pattern….Israel has no intention of funding the rebuilding of Gaza with Israeli money. But that doesnt mean Israel will prevent others from funding the rebuilding of Gaza, mainly from donations from USA, Europe, Arab, Muslim countries and rest of international world but not Israel.

6. I dont have the facts, can someone check how was the six days war fought in Jerusalem ? If my theory is correct, my prediction would be, there should be minimal destruction in Jerusalem. Israel wants/wanted Jerusalem, and to be intact, not flatten. See the difference with Gaza Strip. 

7. What is Jerusalem worth ? Saladdin replied Nothing, then said Everything. I am not saying its historically accurate, i wanted to emphasize how people think. Jerusalem is worth nothing and everything. You wont want to destroy something that valuable. 

8. At the beginning of the Ukraine war, did you noticed the Russia’s attack was very tactical and calculated…lets attack the telecommunication system, military bases, military airbase, railway lines etc… I think at this moment, Putin really thought Ukraine was part of Russia, so he wasnt intending to flatten Ukraine. But Putin’s invasion plans didnt go as plan, F£*&amp; it… then Russia started to change tactic and started to obliterate cities like Bahmut, Mariupol, Kharkiv, etc... Well, if Putin cant have Ukraine, nobody else can…. might as well flatten it. 

9. Even if any US states try to secede from USA, the US military is unlikely going to flatten their cities. Because Washington would have concluded that is part of US land, we shouldnt cause that much destruction. Not to mention the bad press, criticism, protests, etc… the people there are American citizens and they might have family and friends in other parts of the USA. If its not US land, well… I can tell you the approach will be very different.

10. These intentions are not static, and can change. Trump probably has a few ideas of his own and will start making changes next year. Currently, there is rumors that part of Gaza Strip in the north might be turned into a buffer zone by IDF. I think the reason is for security purpose, not for the purpose to annex and not to settle in Gaza.

https://x.com/MTVEnglishNews/status/1863159187968045521   

It seems fighting is still continuing by Israelis against Hezbollah.   

As far as I know, Israel couldn't negotiate a deal to end hezbollah but instead negotiated a deal to only move hezbollah north of the litani and not allow new weapon supplies, but it did not mention any ideas of disarming hezbollah north of the litani. This was the ceasefire terms agreed upon both sides.   

While it would have been better for Lebanese and for Israelis to have a deal ensuring disarming Hezbollah as a foreign backed militia in Lebanon, this was not the deal Israel was achieved.   

Ever since the ceasefire, Israel has continued attacks on what it claims are hezbollah targets, but they are doing so even north of the Litani river where the deal that both sides agreed to did not mention that hezbollah can't operate there.   

I'm afraid this will do nothing but put anyone who opposes hezbollah from the Lebanese side in a bad position because this would only prove that you can't trust israeli ceasefires and terms. This will only give hezbollah more reasons to remain legitimate and will dismiss any Lebanese efforts to take control.     
   
   
EDIT: From one of the replies:

[link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/israel-hezbollah-syria-ceasefire-gaza-world-central-kitchen/)

&gt; An Israeli airstrike on a car in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed five people, including employees of World Central Kitchen. The charity said it was ""urgently seeking more details"" after Israel's military said it targeted a WCK worker who was part of the Hamas attack that sparked the war.

&gt; Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites along Syria's border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said Saturday, testing a fragile, days-old ceasefire that has seen continued sporadic fire.

&gt; The military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria into Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect, which the military said was a violation of its terms. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities or Hezbollah.

Hezbollah smuggling arms is a clear violation of ceasefire terms

However, that does not explain why Israel has bombed a member of the Lebanese Army in the far north. They're also destroying random buildings in the south, that was not part of any agreement.

Because those 1940's actions shaped the Palestinian narrative and the justification used to continue perpetrating the conflict. For example the October 7th massacre.

&gt;Do you judge equally the descendants of other potential allies of the Axis like Thailand, Italy, Hungary, &amp; Japan?

Yes, absolutely. If they deny, justify or rewrite the history of those atrocities/relations. I can assert that a common [criticism of Ukraine and Zelensky here in Israel](https://www.newsweek.com/zelenskys-lies-cant-hide-ukraines-bloody-role-holocaust-opinion-1747875) is his connections to people who are historical revisionists and try to deny Ukraine government aiding to massacre Jews during the Holocaust.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas.

He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces.

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

3183,m0035dd,1,"&gt;First of all this is an urban warfare and in urban warfare the usual ratio between civilians and militants is about 1:9 

The ""1:9"" figure comes from a comment made in the UN, from a snapshot of one year, and actually includes the ongoing conflict in the West Bank at the time. The only actual conflicts with anything like that ratio are conflicts which involved huge and horrific war crimes, so arguing that it's less bad and therefore Israel can't be doing anything wrong is a bit like arguing that a double murderer can't be that bad a person because spree killers are much worse. All it tells you is that things can be worse, not that what's happening is therefore devoid of war crimes. 

&gt;but in this war its about 1:2 

We don't have good enough information on this, but the attempts at tallying victims mostly put the 1:2 ratio as being 2 women/children for every man killed. That only gives you a 1:2 ratio if every man in Gaza is a member of Hamas, which we know isn't the case because there are about 650,000 men in Gaza and Hamas' strength was estimated at 25-40,000 at the beginning of the conflict. It's possible that Israel are tallying all adult men as combatants in their figures as the US has a history of doing this, and the leaks discussing their AI systems have claimed that the only human verification in the pipeline was to look at the images to see if any of the targets were women or children. But obviously we can't actually assume men are combatants. In truth we should probably expect more innocent male victims because they're more likely to be outside, more likely to be working jobs that involve driving vehicles etc, and more likely to be deliberately targeted.

&gt;Also it's important to note that israel warns civilians before every attack

We have very little idea how many effective warnings Israel has given, at least in comparison to the number of strikes. They've damaged or destroyed around 140,000 buildings at this point. Communications have been regularly disrupted or entirely unavailable. You can credit them for making at least some effort but there's far too much fog of war to know what impact any of that had.

&gt;roof knocking, etc...

The IDF said at the start of the conflict that roof knocking would now only be used in ""exceptional"" circumstances, and as far as I can tell they haven't mentioned it at all since then, so we can assume they haven't been doing this.

&gt;In conclusion, war is bad and its awful that innocent civilian and kids die

Do you have any thoughts on the widespread practice of [forcing civilians to check buildings and tunnels for traps](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-08-13/ty-article-magazine/.premium/idf-uses-gazan-civilians-as-human-shields-to-inspect-potentially-booby-trapped-tunnels/00000191-4c84-d7fd-a7f5-7db6b99e0000)? Because it's quite difficult to believe that the IDF as a whole gives much of a damn about civilian casualties when they're using civilians as literal human shields.

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

I’d still like to believe that but much of what has happened in response to this conflict makes that hard. I’m not getting why,if not for antisemitism, are people are so anti-Zionist and why this conflict is so focussed on. I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement? 

And this isn’t the only conflict in the world. It’s not even the largest by people killed or involved. Here is a map that shows all current conflicts. https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker 

Most I hadn’t even heard of, but why no focus on the conflicts and genocide in Sudan where 25 million people need humanitarian aid and 12 million have been displaced? Why is the focus on Ukraine minimal when it is one if the most despicable wars ever with the potential of the collapse of Western society? 

People deny this is rooted in antisemitism and I want to believe they’re accurate, but in our community, we just can’t come up with any other reason! So if you are Anti-Zionist, what do you think Zionism is? Do we not have the right to self define? Is the definition offensive to you?

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally.

Yet, despite this significant offer, none of the 101 hostages have been successfully returned so far. What makes this even more perplexing is the clear evidence that some of the hostages are being sheltered and cared for by Gazan civilians. This raises an unsettling question: how could a father, who has the chance to secure safety, a better future for his family, and an improved quality of life, choose instead to keep a hostage? 

This decision defies logic on multiple levels. It is not just about the economic or material benefits offered by Israel. The offer promises a lifeline, an escape from the hardships and dangers that many Gazan civilians face daily. Accepting such an offer would theoretically guarantee safety from ongoing conflicts, access to better healthcare and education, and a future of stability. Yet, the fact that no one has taken advantage of this opportunity suggests a deeper, more troubling dynamic at play.

It leads me to consider whether hatred toward Israelis surpasses the love for their own children among some Gazans. Is the hostility so deeply ingrained that it eclipses even the instinctual drive to protect and provide for their families? This possibility is deeply unsettling, as it speaks to a cycle of animosity that overrides self-preservation and the pursuit of a better life. Such a choice not only perpetuates suffering but also raises important questions about the role of ideology, community pressure, and fear in shaping these decisions.

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.",It's Barack Obama's fault that the Peace Process collapsed. ,0.41,0,0,12/02/2024 08:35,1,Pro-Israel

Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence, who prevented holocaust survivors from seeking refuge in the British Mandate.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted. Please research the ways Palestinians are treated in Lebanon and Jordan, where they are banned from certain professions, from owning property, from having full citizenship, all so they can be used as a political tool to put pressure on Israel.

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

So im asking what if tomorrow there was peace and former palestinian fighters had a change of heart and became pro israel and supported israel and decided to fight for israel and joined israels armed forces wouldnt that be a very potent mix of arab fighting, jewish warrior spirit and western technology wouldnt that make the israeli army the best in the region?",If there was peace tomorrow and Palestine and Israel were at peace then would Palestine and Israel likely become the main powerhouses of MENA?,0.6,4,0,12/01/2024 05:10,-1,Pro-Palestine

He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces.

The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally.

Nowhere in a whole century's worth of Zionist literature is it outright stated or implied that Zionism is some ultranationalistic Jewish supremacist movement. There are a few concerning usage of words here an there but again, that's on the individuals who wrote that. Zionism was and is nothing but a movement that advocates for a sovereign state that protects the interests of the Jewish people. It makes no specifications about displacing an ""x"" group of people in ""x"" continent or country for the establishment of the planned state. Even a sovereign Jewish state on Hawaii or the outskirts of Madagascar would've satisfied the the requirements of Zionism. Your folly is conflating the far-right Jewish nationalism (which arose due to the hostilities between Palestinians and Jewish immigrants following WW2) with Zionism.

Daniela Weiss and her band of terrorists are going to keep pushing for settling Netzarim and Northern Gaza every day. These scum follow a rutual where they turn up at the Netzarim gates every morning, and they seem increasingly confident in interviews. I guess we'll see who is right.

My primary sources are Israel Hayom and Haaretz.

If you think Gaza belongs to you, your property, you would not have flatten much of Gaza. I still think the current top Israeli leadership also doesnt want to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip.

1. Ben-Gurion and early zionists may have commented on Greater Israel. But time has changed, the current top leadership is no Ben-Gurion. Similarly, Trump is no Biden. The government policies will change depending on the leader and changes with the time.

2. Daniella Weiss, Ben-Gvir, Smotrich and other extreme right wings may be salivating at the idea of re-establishing Gush Katif settlements (formerly near Khan Yunis) in the southern Gaza Strip. But none of them were part of the former top Israeli war cabinet, and even currently they do not direct or lead the war. They may try, but this is not official government policy. 

I am trying to explain that is/was not the intention of Israel/IDF to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip. It’s kinda an ancient war maxime (idk what is it called), but you dont destroy the land/ all the buildings if you want to conquer itand considered that land belongs to you.

3. During WW2, Germany didnt destroy Paris. They tried when they were losing and evacuating, but not at the start. They wanted Paris to be intact. And you would too if you are conquering Paris. There is a suggestion (some might dispute it) that the German leader who cannot be named during WW2, did not REALLY wanted to conquer Britain. After defeating France, Germany thought Britain would make peace. There were lots of destruction during the Battle of Britain especially London.

4. US dropped nuclear bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, flatten them. US had no intention of permanently conquering Japan. US never saw Japan as part of US land. US wanted to end the war, and thought using nuclear bomb will do that, and it did, Japan surrendered. US was in Japan for a bit to sort things out then quickly handed over to a transitional Japanese government. US had no intention of conquering Japan.

5. US dropped more than 7.5 million tons of bombs in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. US had no intention of permanently conquering Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos. It’s easier to completely destroy something you dont want/need and even easier if you are not the one going to clean up the mess later down the line. See the pattern….Israel has no intention of funding the rebuilding of Gaza with Israeli money. But that doesnt mean Israel will prevent others from funding the rebuilding of Gaza, mainly from donations from USA, Europe, Arab, Muslim countries and rest of international world but not Israel.

6. I dont have the facts, can someone check how was the six days war fought in Jerusalem ? If my theory is correct, my prediction would be, there should be minimal destruction in Jerusalem. Israel wants/wanted Jerusalem, and to be intact, not flatten. See the difference with Gaza Strip. 

7. What is Jerusalem worth ? Saladdin replied Nothing, then said Everything. I am not saying its historically accurate, i wanted to emphasize how people think. Jerusalem is worth nothing and everything. You wont want to destroy something that valuable. 

8. At the beginning of the Ukraine war, did you noticed the Russia’s attack was very tactical and calculated…lets attack the telecommunication system, military bases, military airbase, railway lines etc… I think at this moment, Putin really thought Ukraine was part of Russia, so he wasnt intending to flatten Ukraine. But Putin’s invasion plans didnt go as plan, F£*&amp; it… then Russia started to change tactic and started to obliterate cities like Bahmut, Mariupol, Kharkiv, etc... Well, if Putin cant have Ukraine, nobody else can…. might as well flatten it. 

9. Even if any US states try to secede from USA, the US military is unlikely going to flatten their cities. Because Washington would have concluded that is part of US land, we shouldnt cause that much destruction. Not to mention the bad press, criticism, protests, etc… the people there are American citizens and they might have family and friends in other parts of the USA. If its not US land, well… I can tell you the approach will be very different.

10. These intentions are not static, and can change. Trump probably has a few ideas of his own and will start making changes next year. Currently, there is rumors that part of Gaza Strip in the north might be turned into a buffer zone by IDF. I think the reason is for security purpose, not for the purpose to annex and not to settle in Gaza. And I dont think it will be permanent either.",I think the former top Israel war cabinet had no intention to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip,0.51,1,0,12/01/2024 12:56,0,Neutral
1109,m041urw,1,"&gt;but from once respectable institutions like the UN and ICC

But they also spend time and attention on other conflicts.

And you are forgetting that the U.S. is still the most powerful country in the world. The U.S. supporting Israel provokes outrage from countries world wide who see how standards for human rights are conveniently ignored for allies of the U.S.

The UN and ICC are supposed to represent the world, not just the U.S. so when the rest of the world is appalled by the U.S. giving Israel a free pass it is expressed through these international institutions. It is a limited way to try to enforce international norms despite U.S. and Israeli exceptionalism.

&gt;which don't say anything about the current Sudan genocide which killed 3 times the amount of Palestinians.

But the U.S. sanctions both the RSF and SAF. Again, U.S. policy towards Sudan is much closer to my preferred policy than U.S. policy towards Israel.

&gt;And you do not understand antisemitism.

I rather think that you perceive antisemitism where there is none.

&gt;Caring for something only if a Jew is involved is antisemitic.

Agreed, although by that standard Israel is extremely antisemitic.

But the issue is Pro-Palestine supporters aren't interested because Jewish people are involved. They are interested because they oppose apartheid.

When people were interested in South Africa it wasn't because they were prejudiced against Afrikaners. If people are upset over Ukraine it isn't because they are prejudiced against Russians.

There are many reasons why one cause ends up catching more attention than others. Ignoring all those reasons and just shouting ""antisemitism"" again and again and again is a painfully myopic and self-serving perspective.

Let's consider some of the other reasons why Israel/Palestine has caught the public's eye:

* It connects to anti-colonial sentiments. Zionism advanced under the rule of Western colonial powers and was funded primarily by Europeans. The vast majority of original settlers came from Europe and Israel is generally perceived as White. The Israel/Palestine conflict therefore is of particular interest to those upset over western colonialism and imperialism.
* The U.S. is a major supporter of Israel. Moving aircraft carriers, selling weapons, vetoing SC resolutions, threatening international institutions, pardoning spies, recognizing illegal annexations, etc... On this issue, unlike many others you mention, a significant number of people think the U.S. is fundamentally on the wrong side.
* The earlier ethnic cleansing operations of Israel have produced a large Palestinian diaspora. There are over three times as many Palestinians in the U.S. compared to Sudanese Americans. Having more people who are personally affected by the issue increases its exposure.
* Similarly, although a minority, there are also a large number of anti-Zionist Jews. There are 7.5 million Jewish people in the U.S. According to [this survey](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/05/11/u-s-jews-connections-with-and-attitudes-toward-israel/) about 10% support BDS. That is 750,000 people. Jewish people in the U.S. tend to be more engaged with the subject of Israel/Palestine, so 750,000 more people who are critical of Israel have an impact. In fact, the discrimination anti-Zionist Jews often face from their communities can lead to a strengthening of their convictions, creating more passionate activists in support of Palestine.",IsraelPalestine,12/02/2024 22:57,1h4mvic,SilasRhodes,0,1,0,TRUE,10/01/2016 10:48,1236,1054,10563,123341,136194,59,"I grew up for 40 years thinking mass antisemitism was a thing of the past. I’d still like to believe that but much of what has happened in response to this conflict makes that hard. I’m not getting why,if not for antisemitism, are people are so anti-Zionist and why this conflict is so focussed on. I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement? 

And this isn’t the only conflict in the world. It’s not even the largest by people killed or involved. Here is a map that shows all current conflicts. https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker

https://x.com/MTVEnglishNews/status/1863159187968045521   

It seems fighting is still continuing by Israelis against Hezbollah.   

As far as I know, Israel couldn't negotiate a deal to end hezbollah but instead negotiated a deal to only move hezbollah north of the litani and not allow new weapon supplies, but it did not mention any ideas of disarming hezbollah north of the litani. This was the ceasefire terms agreed upon both sides.   

While it would have been better for Lebanese and for Israelis to have a deal ensuring disarming Hezbollah as a foreign backed militia in Lebanon, this was not the deal Israel was achieved.   

Ever since the ceasefire, Israel has continued attacks on what it claims are hezbollah targets, but they are doing so even north of the Litani river where the deal that both sides agreed to did not mention that hezbollah can't operate there.   

I'm afraid this will do nothing but put anyone who opposes hezbollah from the Lebanese side in a bad position because this would only prove that you can't trust israeli ceasefires and terms. This will only give hezbollah more reasons to remain legitimate and will dismiss any Lebanese efforts to take control.     
   
   
EDIT: From one of the replies:

[link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/israel-hezbollah-syria-ceasefire-gaza-world-central-kitchen/)

&gt; An Israeli airstrike on a car in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed five people, including employees of World Central Kitchen. The charity said it was ""urgently seeking more details"" after Israel's military said it targeted a WCK worker who was part of the Hamas attack that sparked the war.

&gt; Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites along Syria's border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said Saturday, testing a fragile, days-old ceasefire that has seen continued sporadic fire.

&gt; The military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria into Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect, which the military said was a violation of its terms. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities or Hezbollah.

Hezbollah smuggling arms is a clear violation of ceasefire terms

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

Yet, despite this significant offer, none of the 101 hostages have been successfully returned so far. What makes this even more perplexing is the clear evidence that some of the hostages are being sheltered and cared for by Gazan civilians. This raises an unsettling question: how could a father, who has the chance to secure safety, a better future for his family, and an improved quality of life, choose instead to keep a hostage? 

This decision defies logic on multiple levels. It is not just about the economic or material benefits offered by Israel. The offer promises a lifeline, an escape from the hardships and dangers that many Gazan civilians face daily. Accepting such an offer would theoretically guarantee safety from ongoing conflicts, access to better healthcare and education, and a future of stability. Yet, the fact that no one has taken advantage of this opportunity suggests a deeper, more troubling dynamic at play.

It leads me to consider whether hatred toward Israelis surpasses the love for their own children among some Gazans. Is the hostility so deeply ingrained that it eclipses even the instinctual drive to protect and provide for their families? This possibility is deeply unsettling, as it speaks to a cycle of animosity that overrides self-preservation and the pursuit of a better life.

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

Yet, despite this significant offer, none of the 101 hostages have been successfully returned so far. What makes this even more perplexing is the clear evidence that some of the hostages are being sheltered and cared for by Gazan civilians. This raises an unsettling question: how could a father, who has the chance to secure safety, a better future for his family, and an improved quality of life, choose instead to keep a hostage? 

This decision defies logic on multiple levels. It is not just about the economic or material benefits offered by Israel. The offer promises a lifeline, an escape from the hardships and dangers that many Gazan civilians face daily. Accepting such an offer would theoretically guarantee safety from ongoing conflicts, access to better healthcare and education, and a future of stability. Yet, the fact that no one has taken advantage of this opportunity suggests a deeper, more troubling dynamic at play.

It leads me to consider whether hatred toward Israelis surpasses the love for their own children among some Gazans.
