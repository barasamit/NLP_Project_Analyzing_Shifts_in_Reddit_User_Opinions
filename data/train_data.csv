I’d still like to believe that but much of what has happened in response to this conflict makes that hard. I’m not getting why,if not for antisemitism, are people are so anti-Zionist and why this conflict is so focussed on. I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement? 

And this isn’t the only conflict in the world. It’s not even the largest by people killed or involved. Here is a map that shows all current conflicts. https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker 

Most I hadn’t even heard of, but why no focus on the conflicts and genocide in Sudan where 25 million people need humanitarian aid and 12 million have been displaced? Why is the focus on Ukraine minimal when it is one if the most despicable wars ever with the potential of the collapse of Western society? 

People deny this is rooted in antisemitism and I want to believe they’re accurate, but in our community, we just can’t come up with any other reason! So if you are Anti-Zionist, what do you think Zionism is? Do we not have the right to self define? Is the definition offensive to you? And why is this conflict so important to you if you aren’t Jewish, Israeli, Palestinian, Iranian, Muslim etc? Why not other conflicts?

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

",The Palestinian cause has already won in the court of public opinion,0.52,13,0,12/1/2024 22:32,-1.0,Pro-Palestine
138,m06mmqu,1,"So I have addressed many of these talking points before but I will give a break down of each. 

1)Fleeing persecution and colonizing an area are not mutually exclusive things. The Puritans who came to America as part of a settler colonial enterprise were fleeing religious persecution in England. It was still colonialism. Among some of the Spanish settlers in the Americas you had not just conquistadors and missionaries, but also conversos and some members of the Sephardic Jewish community fleeing the persecution of the Spanish Inquisition. They were still settlers when they came to the New World as part of a colonial enterprise. 

2)As of now the notion that Muslims have equal rights in Israel is something that is questionable. Itamar Ben Gavir literally instructed Israeli police to prevent Mosques from being able to engage in the call to prayer which is a central part of Islamic religious practice. 

3)The notion that displacement only took place when a ""genocidal war"" was waged on Israel is a myth that Israeli nationalists and the Pro Israel movement repeats to itself. It's premised on the notion that the Arab armies attacked, they got defeated, and that is why Palestinians are refugees. Except it gets the history exactly backwards. In 47 and 48 the wars that took place happened in two crucial stages. The first is the Palestine civil war of 47. The second is the wider Arab Israeli war of 48. It was during the Palestine civil war between Palestinian Arabs and members of the Zionist militia groups that refugees emerged. And they emerged primarily due to events such as the Deir Yassin massacre as well as the forcible displacement of Palestinians from villages and towns as part of operations such as Plan D which formulated all the way back in the 30s. It was in reaction to the influx of Palestinian refugees into their countries that the Arab nations then attacked Israel, especially after the Deir Yassin massacre. Because both the massacres as well as the presence of refugees inflamed Arab public opinion at the time. So it is simply false to claim that the Arab attack in 48 caused the refugee problem. The refugee problem was one of the catalysts for the Arab attack. 

4)I would agree that using the term ""white supremacy"" in the context of the Israel Palestine conflict is not helpful. Settler colonial however can still be appropriate. Settler colonial systems can utilized white supremacy, but they are not bound by white supremacy or any particular racial group. For example in Afghanistan during its history the Pashtun population engaged in their own form of settler colonialism of the Northern part of the country.  But ""white supremacy"" wasn't the motivating factor there. Indonesia is engaged in a settler colonial project right now in West Papua which one of the longest running occupations going on since 1962. So ""white supremacy"" isn't the right terminology here. Settler colonialism, along with racism and Orientalism would be better fits. 

5)Colonialism comes in different forms. You don't have to be a colony of another nation to be engaging in a particular form of colonialism. Colonialism that is tied to Imperialism requires those things. Settler colonialism as well as other forms such as internal colonialism do not. Just like ideologies such as Capitalism, Communism, Liberalism, etc there are different expressions of Colonialism. The notion that colonialism has to be tied down to one expression is false.",IsraelPalestine,12/3/2024 11:07,1h5k8xu,Anglicanpolitics123,0,1,0,True,9/27/2019 6:53,8526,0,53539,34125,96190,12,"'Settler-Colonial' implies that people moved to the region by choice and displaced the indigenous population. Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence, who prevented holocaust survivors from seeking refuge in the British Mandate.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted. Please research the ways Palestinians are treated in Lebanon and Jordan, where they are banned from certain professions, from owning property, from having full citizenship, all so they can be used as a political tool to put pressure on Israel.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

The land belonged to Britain, Britain would have more knowledge of the territory they were running, but there were a few different proposals put together.


Please re-read the resolution (link at the end, but im sure you'reabke to goodle and read the actual resolution from the UN) each country had 2 months to set up a provisional government and hold elections no later then 2 months after Britain left, which was to be no later then 1st of August 1948. There was no multi year plan and no Arab was to live in Jewish land and no Jew to live in Arab land unless special authorisation was provided by the Mandate or the provisional government. Just like for the countries I mentioned before.


India and Pakistan have animosity between them as do Syria and Lebanon, but they also have ties, those are not black and white, there is a lot of grey as all new countries have.


You talk about colonialism and I can't help but wonder the definition? Are you trying to use the definition from the 1500's? Are you confusing this with Imperialism? Do you think that people under a dictatorship like Russia was (or still is depending on your views) or any of the Middle Eastern Kingdoms had it? Due to that resolution the possibility of self determination for bother Jewish Palestinians and  Arab Palestinians came to be.


Funny you should mention Sicily, have a read about Sicilian history and the Unification of Italy. Or just chat with Italians that will not introduce themselves as Italians but as Napolitans or Sicilians, but that's already really long and off topic.


Ethnic cleansing means something else, it means killing or removing a whole ethnicity the Israelis have not done that or attempted to do that, the Arabs that remained in Israel have become full citizens, they are about 20% of Israel's population, they have changed nationalities, though not ethnicity and some still consider themselves Palestinians. But the Modern Palestinian population has only increased worldwide. The population if Gaza has increased since the war started that does not happen in cases of ethnic cleansing.

https://x.com/MTVEnglishNews/status/1863159187968045521   

It seems fighting is still continuing by Israelis against Hezbollah.   

As far as I know, Israel couldn't negotiate a deal to end hezbollah but instead negotiated a deal to only move hezbollah north of the litani and not allow new weapon supplies, but it did not mention any ideas of disarming hezbollah north of the litani. This was the ceasefire terms agreed upon both sides.   

While it would have been better for Lebanese and for Israelis to have a deal ensuring disarming Hezbollah as a foreign backed militia in Lebanon, this was not the deal Israel was achieved.   

Ever since the ceasefire, Israel has continued attacks on what it claims are hezbollah targets, but they are doing so even north of the Litani river where the deal that both sides agreed to did not mention that hezbollah can't operate there.   

I'm afraid this will do nothing but put anyone who opposes hezbollah from the Lebanese side in a bad position because this would only prove that you can't trust israeli ceasefires and terms. This will only give hezbollah more reasons to remain legitimate and will dismiss any Lebanese efforts to take control.     
   
   
EDIT: From one of the replies:

[link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/israel-hezbollah-syria-ceasefire-gaza-world-central-kitchen/)

&gt; An Israeli airstrike on a car in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed five people, including employees of World Central Kitchen. The charity said it was ""urgently seeking more details"" after Israel's military said it targeted a WCK worker who was part of the Hamas attack that sparked the war.

&gt; Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites along Syria's border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said Saturday, testing a fragile, days-old ceasefire that has seen continued sporadic fire.

&gt; The military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria into Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect, which the military said was a violation of its terms. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities or Hezbollah.

Hezbollah smuggling arms is a clear violation of ceasefire terms

However, that does not explain why Israel has bombed a member of the Lebanese Army in the far north. They're also destroying random buildings in the south, that was not part of any agreement.

Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence, who prevented holocaust survivors from seeking refuge in the British Mandate.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted. Please research the ways Palestinians are treated in Lebanon and Jordan, where they are banned from certain professions, from owning property, from having full citizenship, all so they can be used as a political tool to put pressure on Israel.

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.



Anyways, I could go on, but I think my general point has been made…

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

When the mandate ws established it was a tiny proportion of the overall population.

&gt;the territory was divided by the UN

Following a policy essentially devised by Britain and the U.S. at the urging of Zionist organizations. A division that flagrantly gerrymandered to give the maximum possible land to the minority population  with western backing.

But despite this Zionists couldn't even adhere to the partition plan which called for a multi-year transition process intended to integrate the two countries to maintain economic and social ties. Instead Zionists declared independence immediately, starting the Palestinian civil war.

&gt;Much like Lebanon and Syria were divided with Lebanon for the Christians and Syria for the Muslims, or like India and Pakistan were divided

and we all know how well that went. It is almost like western powers are wildly unqualified to play map maker with other people's land.

Yes. Because of Colonialism. The World Zionist organization actively lobbied to the British to seize control of Palestine.

I think it’s maybe hard to imagine until you’re in the situation but the reality is the human brain isn’t meant to hold all the pain of everyone in every situation, and it’s hardwired to the in-group / out-group concept. It’s is biologically normal for an Israeli to feel more grief and pain for the losses on the Israeli side and to feel distance from the pain and loss on the Palestinian side and the same is true of Palestinians, and you will see it also from their side, if you ever bring up the hostages you may find responses that pull the focus back to Palestinian suffering and that’s biologically normal. 

That being said, if you find yourself in a conversation where Gazan children come up, I think you will find that people will say that it hurts them. Not the same way Israeli losses or the plight of the hostages might, but still in a human way, the average Israeli is not apathetic to the death of children.

Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence, who prevented holocaust survivors from seeking refuge in the British Mandate.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted. Please research the ways Palestinians are treated in Lebanon and Jordan, where they are banned from certain professions, from owning property, from having full citizenship, all so they can be used as a political tool to put pressure on Israel.

&gt;And this isn’t the only conflict in the world. It’s not even the largest by people killed or involved.

This argument has been made thousands of times before but the answer hasn't changed. The Israel Palestine conflict is different because Israel is backed by the U.S.

The war in Sudan is devastating, but the U.S. isn't sending billions of dollars of weapons to Sudan. The U.S. isn't shielding either the SAF or RSF in the UN.

So here is my proposal: Treat Israel exactly the same. Stop sending weapons. Investigate human rights abuses. If Israel refuses to cooperate sanction it like we would any other country.

You are right that the response is different, but by and large the response is different *in favor of Israel*.

I think it is worth thinking about the biases in your community and the narratives that it unconsciously adopts. Israel has promoted the idea that to oppose Israel must be antisemitic. It has pushed this narrative very strongly because it helps Israel to discredit its detractors, especially in Jewish circles.

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.

I’d still like to believe that but much of what has happened in response to this conflict makes that hard. I’m not getting why,if not for antisemitism, are people are so anti-Zionist and why this conflict is so focussed on. I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement? 

And this isn’t the only conflict in the world. It’s not even the largest by people killed or involved. Here is a map that shows all current conflicts. https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker 

Most I hadn’t even heard of, but why no focus on the conflicts and genocide in Sudan where 25 million people need humanitarian aid and 12 million have been displaced? Why is the focus on Ukraine minimal when it is one if the most despicable wars ever with the potential of the collapse of Western society? 

People deny this is rooted in antisemitism and I want to believe they’re accurate, but in our community, we just can’t come up with any other reason! So if you are Anti-Zionist, what do you think Zionism is? Do we not have the right to self define? Is the definition offensive to you?

But they also spend time and attention on other conflicts.

And you are forgetting that the U.S. is still the most powerful country in the world. The U.S. supporting Israel provokes outrage from countries world wide who see how standards for human rights are conveniently ignored for allies of the U.S.

The UN and ICC are supposed to represent the world, not just the U.S. so when the rest of the world is appalled by the U.S. giving Israel a free pass it is expressed through these international institutions. It is a limited way to try to enforce international norms despite U.S. and Israeli exceptionalism.

&gt;which don't say anything about the current Sudan genocide which killed 3 times the amount of Palestinians.

But the U.S. sanctions both the RSF and SAF. Again, U.S. policy towards Sudan is much closer to my preferred policy than U.S. policy towards Israel.

&gt;And you do not understand antisemitism.

I rather think that you perceive antisemitism where there is none.

&gt;Caring for something only if a Jew is involved is antisemitic.

Agreed, although by that standard Israel is extremely antisemitic.

But the issue is Pro-Palestine supporters aren't interested because Jewish people are involved. They are interested because they oppose apartheid.

When people were interested in South Africa it wasn't because they were prejudiced against Afrikaners. If people are upset over Ukraine it isn't because they are prejudiced against Russians.

There are many reasons why one cause ends up catching more attention than others. Ignoring all those reasons and just shouting ""antisemitism"" again and again and again is a painfully myopic and self-serving perspective.

Let's consider some of the other reasons why Israel/Palestine has caught the public's eye:

* It connects to anti-colonial sentiments. Zionism advanced under the rule of Western colonial powers and was funded primarily by Europeans. The vast majority of original settlers came from Europe and Israel is generally perceived as White. The Israel/Palestine conflict therefore is of particular interest to those upset over western colonialism and imperialism.
* The U.S. is a major supporter of Israel. Moving aircraft carriers, selling weapons, vetoing SC resolutions, threatening international institutions, pardoning spies, recognizing illegal annexations, etc... On this issue, unlike many others you mention, a significant number of people think the U.S. is fundamentally on the wrong side.
* The earlier ethnic cleansing operations of Israel have produced a large Palestinian diaspora. There are over three times as many Palestinians in the U.S. compared to Sudanese Americans. Having more people who are personally affected by the issue increases its exposure.
* Similarly, although a minority, there are also a large number of anti-Zionist Jews. There are 7.5 million Jewish people in the U.S. According to [this survey](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/05/11/u-s-jews-connections-with-and-attitudes-toward-israel/) about 10% support BDS. That is 750,000 people. Jewish people in the U.S. tend to be more engaged with the subject of Israel/Palestine, so 750,000 more people who are critical of Israel have an impact. In fact, the discrimination anti-Zionist Jews often face from their communities can lead to a strengthening of their convictions, creating more passionate activists in support of Palestine.",IsraelPalestine,12/2/2024 22:57,1h4mvic,SilasRhodes,0,1,0,True,10/1/2016 10:48,1236,1054,10563,123341,136194,59,"I grew up for 40 years thinking mass antisemitism was a thing of the past. I’d still like to believe that but much of what has happened in response to this conflict makes that hard. I’m not getting why,if not for antisemitism, are people are so anti-Zionist and why this conflict is so focussed on. I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement? 

And this isn’t the only conflict in the world. It’s not even the largest by people killed or involved. Here is a map that shows all current conflicts. https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker 

Most I hadn’t even heard of, but why no focus on the conflicts and genocide in Sudan where 25 million people need humanitarian aid and 12 million have been displaced? Why is the focus on Ukraine minimal when it is one if the most despicable wars ever with the potential of the collapse of Western society? 

People deny this is rooted in antisemitism and I want to believe they’re accurate, but in our community, we just can’t come up with any other reason! So if you are Anti-Zionist, what do you think Zionism is? Do we not have the right to self define? Is the definition offensive to you? And why is this conflict so important to you if you aren’t Jewish, Israeli, Palestinian, Iranian, Muslim etc? Why not other conflicts?

[https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna34151442](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna34151442)

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

I know the general idea was to create a place where Jews would be safe, and I suppose that's the main reason to keep a Jewish majority. 

But are there other reasons?  Maybe some scriptural basis for needing to be majority Jewish?  I can't find any so far.  There's certainly a scriptural basis for the idea of Jews having a *connection* to the land of Israel, but there's nothing I've found in the Jewish tradition/scriture that says Jews need to be in the majority. 

Or maybe something totally different? I know Israel was *planned* as a Jewish state by the UN partition plan, same as Pakistan was planned as a Muslim state.. 

I'm not challenging the idea that it should be majority Jewish. (There's basically no such thing as a state whose native ethnic people has not remained in the majority -- France, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Germany, especially Japan, etc., all remain something like 85%-95% ethnically homogeneous.  So I don't see anything strange about Jews being the majority in Israel.) 

So I'm not asking ""why"" as a way to criticize Israel.  I'm searching for all the possible reasons why any stakeholders want to keep it majority Jewish.  

I also have a followup question:  What was the reason for Zionists wanting a Jewish majority when they established Israel?

829,m04wkm7,1,"I feel the main mistake you're making is assuming Israel has some long-term scheme. As if it's some hivemind, or was always ruled by a single dictator. In reality, various Israelis have their own, competing strategic visions. Even within the same government, due to Israel's multiparty system. And on the other hand, there are national priorities, and the real life (diplomatic, economic, military) limitations. 

The settler movement doesn't want a two state solution, and believes that settlements would prevent it. But they have never managed to convince the Israeli public that the settlements, or tying Israel's hands in future negotiations are national priorities. At most, the Palestinians, not the settlers, have convinced Israelis that the settlements are not the thing that stands between them and peace. And Israeli withdrawals, while Palestinians are still yearning (as a matter of their #1 national priority) to eliminate Israel, will only lead to a lot of dead Israelis and Palestinians. But if these circumstances change, or somehow Israel's actual core motives are threatened, so will the public opinion.

As for bypass roads and whatnot: the vast majority of settlers are in small blocks next to your border, and in East Jerusalem. Removing the small settlements that dot the land doesn't mean removing half a million people. Nobody said that if the settlements aren't all removed, the Palestinians are left only with areas A and B. And even in the plans where they are left with those areas, like the Trump plan or Bennett's old proposal, they absolutely control roads and tunnels that connect between those pieces. And even if not, if there's peace, it's solvable with some sort of an agreement - as with the myriad of enclaves and exclaves within Baarle-Nassau, the second-level enclave between UAE and Oman, the insanity on the India-Bangladesh border etc. And I haven't mentioned other options, like an EU type of arrangement, where settlements and settlers remain in Palestine. Yes, it makes things harder. But no, none of this is fundamentally unsolvable, or inherently makes Palestinian statehood impossible.

There's certainly a scriptural basis for the idea of Jews having a *connection* to the land of Israel, but there's nothing I've found in the Jewish tradition/scriture that says Jews need to be in the majority. 

Or maybe something totally different? I know Israel was *planned* as a Jewish state by the UN partition plan, same as Pakistan was planned as a Muslim state.. 

I'm not challenging the idea that it should be majority Jewish. (There's basically no such thing as a state whose native ethnic people has not remained in the majority -- France, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Germany, especially Japan, etc., all remain something like 85%-95% ethnically homogeneous.  So I don't see anything strange about Jews being the majority in Israel.) 

So I'm not asking ""why"" as a way to criticize Israel.  I'm searching for all the possible reasons why any stakeholders want to keep it majority Jewish.  

I also have a followup question:  What was the reason for Zionists wanting a Jewish majority when they established Israel?  Same as above, I know the obvious reasons for not wanting to be outnumbered by hostiles.  I'm trying to find any *other* reasons.

I’d still like to believe that but much of what has happened in response to this conflict makes that hard. I’m not getting why,if not for antisemitism, are people are so anti-Zionist and why this conflict is so focussed on. I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement? 

And this isn’t the only conflict in the world. It’s not even the largest by people killed or involved. Here is a map that shows all current conflicts. https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker 

Most I hadn’t even heard of, but why no focus on the conflicts and genocide in Sudan where 25 million people need humanitarian aid and 12 million have been displaced? Why is the focus on Ukraine minimal when it is one if the most despicable wars ever with the potential of the collapse of Western society? 

People deny this is rooted in antisemitism and I want to believe they’re accurate, but in our community, we just can’t come up with any other reason! So if you are Anti-Zionist, what do you think Zionism is? Do we not have the right to self define? Is the definition offensive to you?

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

People deny this is rooted in antisemitism and I want to believe they’re accurate, but in our community, we just can’t come up with any other reason! So if you are Anti-Zionist, what do you think Zionism is? Do we not have the right to self define? Is the definition offensive to you?

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.

I’d still like to believe that but much of what has happened in response to this conflict makes that hard. I’m not getting why,if not for antisemitism, are people are so anti-Zionist and why this conflict is so focussed on. I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement? 

And this isn’t the only conflict in the world. It’s not even the largest by people killed or involved. Here is a map that shows all current conflicts. https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker 

Most I hadn’t even heard of, but why no focus on the conflicts and genocide in Sudan where 25 million people need humanitarian aid and 12 million have been displaced? Why is the focus on Ukraine minimal when it is one if the most despicable wars ever with the potential of the collapse of Western society? 

People deny this is rooted in antisemitism and I want to believe they’re accurate, but in our community, we just can’t come up with any other reason! So if you are Anti-Zionist, what do you think Zionism is? Do we not have the right to self define? Is the definition offensive to you? And why is this conflict so important to you if you aren’t Jewish, Israeli, Palestinian, Iranian, Muslim etc? Why not other conflicts?

There's certainly a scriptural basis for the idea of Jews having a *connection* to the land of Israel, but there's nothing I've found in the Jewish tradition/scriture that says Jews need to be in the majority.

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.

I’d still like to believe that but much of what has happened in response to this conflict makes that hard. I’m not getting why,if not for antisemitism, are people are so anti-Zionist and why this conflict is so focussed on. I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

1086,m044gpe,1,This is the simplest right answer I've seen. Israel left Gaza in 2006 and gazans choose Hamas. I live in a very diverse suburban area in the us (80 languages in the high school. I work with loads of Palestinians and am friends with them (Muslim and Christian)and nobody wants war. You can through evangelical Christian Zionists in this basket as well.

Kind of like hating Putin and not the Russian people. Many Muslim genuinely don't like Israelis.im a dual US German citizen. Merkel imported anti seminarian in the form of large amounts of Sunnis Arab migrants that have sympathy for Hamas. Germany is just starting to see this.   Those European governments are seeing that Hamas doesn't want peace or care. The Palestinians haven't legitimate claim to that land one could argue since the 70's. My wife is Serbian and we watched Serbia get Kosovo taken away in 1999. Very painful to this day. They lost it and that's it. The thought of religious extremists blowing up Albanians in Pristina or Albania is laughable. This was only 25 year ago and if my history is correct Albanians have know historic right to that land.

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.



Anyways, I could go on, but I think my general point has been made…

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.

Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence, who prevented holocaust survivors from seeking refuge in the British Mandate.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted. Please research the ways Palestinians are treated in Lebanon and Jordan, where they are banned from certain professions, from owning property, from having full citizenship, all so they can be used as a political tool to put pressure on Israel.

I’d still like to believe that but much of what has happened in response to this conflict makes that hard. I’m not getting why,if not for antisemitism, are people are so anti-Zionist and why this conflict is so focussed on. I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement? 

And this isn’t the only conflict in the world. It’s not even the largest by people killed or involved. Here is a map that shows all current conflicts. https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker 

Most I hadn’t even heard of, but why no focus on the conflicts and genocide in Sudan where 25 million people need humanitarian aid and 12 million have been displaced? Why is the focus on Ukraine minimal when it is one if the most despicable wars ever with the potential of the collapse of Western society? 

People deny this is rooted in antisemitism and I want to believe they’re accurate, but in our community, we just can’t come up with any other reason! So if you are Anti-Zionist, what do you think Zionism is? Do we not have the right to self define? Is the definition offensive to you? And why is this conflict so important to you if you aren’t Jewish, Israeli, Palestinian, Iranian, Muslim etc? Why not other conflicts?

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.



Anyways, I could go on, but I think my general point has been made…

I’d still like to believe that but much of what has happened in response to this conflict makes that hard. I’m not getting why,if not for antisemitism, are people are so anti-Zionist and why this conflict is so focussed on. I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement? 

And this isn’t the only conflict in the world. It’s not even the largest by people killed or involved. Here is a map that shows all current conflicts. https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker 

Most I hadn’t even heard of, but why no focus on the conflicts and genocide in Sudan where 25 million people need humanitarian aid and 12 million have been displaced? Why is the focus on Ukraine minimal when it is one if the most despicable wars ever with the potential of the collapse of Western society? 

People deny this is rooted in antisemitism and I want to believe they’re accurate, but in our community, we just can’t come up with any other reason! So if you are Anti-Zionist, what do you think Zionism is? Do we not have the right to self define? Is the definition offensive to you? And why is this conflict so important to you if you aren’t Jewish, Israeli, Palestinian, Iranian, Muslim etc? Why not other conflicts?

133,m06mvqr,1,"I think it really sinole: there are territories that bdlong to the oalestinians arabs in Palestine: the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza. The first two are under israeli military occupation and taking advantage of this situation, thousands of jewish settlers have expelled Palestinian civilians and stolen land, houses and property protected by the Israeli army, having at their disposal a modern network of exclusive roads, access to water and other benefits to the detriment of the Palestinian population. All this under the banner of building a ""Jewish State"" where minorities like the Palestinians do not have the right to self-determination but are second-class citizens.

That, by any definition, is a ""settler"" project and an ""ethnostate"". 

It's true that there are several “ethostates” in the world, especially in the “first world,” but in the Global South, states are mixed and have several nations within them. From China to India, from Africa to South and Central America. The issue is that Israel “sells” itself as a “democracy” when in reality it oppresses the Palestinians. That is why it is negatively labeled as an Ethnostate despite being composed of a diverse population, and a colonial project because it expands territorially with illegal settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories.",IsraelPalestine,12/3/2024 11:10,1h5k8xu,Agitated_Structure63,0,1,0,True,10/25/2023 19:01,0,0,11,63,74,12,"'Settler-Colonial' implies that people moved to the region by choice and displaced the indigenous population. Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence, who prevented holocaust survivors from seeking refuge in the British Mandate.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted. Please research the ways Palestinians are treated in Lebanon and Jordan, where they are banned from certain professions, from owning property, from having full citizenship, all so they can be used as a political tool to put pressure on Israel.

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

And the numbers confirm this. We'd expect a combatant to civilian death ration of 1:8 in any urban arena (this is ignoring the fact that Hamas goes to extreme lengths to hide behind civilians).

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

2. Daniella Weiss, Ben-Gvir, Smotrich and other extreme right wings may be salivating at the idea of re-establishing Gush Katif settlements (formerly near Khan Yunis) in the southern Gaza Strip.

I am trying to explain that is/was not the intention of Israel/IDF to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip. It’s kinda an ancient war maxime (idk what is it called), but you dont destroy the land/ all the buildings if you want to conquer itand considered that land belongs to you.

3. During WW2, Germany didnt destroy Paris. They tried when they were losing and evacuating, but not at the start. They wanted Paris to be intact. And you would too if you are conquering Paris. There is a suggestion (some might dispute it) that the German leader who cannot be named during WW2, did not REALLY wanted to conquer Britain. After defeating France, Germany thought Britain would make peace. There were lots of destruction during the Battle of Britain especially London.

4. US dropped nuclear bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, flatten them. US had no intention of permanently conquering Japan. US never saw Japan as part of US land. US wanted to end the war, and thought using nuclear bomb will do that, and it did, Japan surrendered. US was in Japan for a bit to sort things out then quickly handed over to a transitional Japanese government. US had no intention of conquering Japan.

5. US dropped more than 7.5 million tons of bombs in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. US had no intention of permanently conquering Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos. It’s easier to completely destroy something you dont want/need and even easier if you are not the one going to clean up the mess later down the line. See the pattern….Israel has no intention of funding the rebuilding of Gaza with Israeli money. But that doesnt mean Israel will prevent others from funding the rebuilding of Gaza, mainly from donations from USA, Europe, Arab, Muslim countries and rest of international world but not Israel.

6. I dont have the facts, can someone check how was the six days war fought in Jerusalem ? If my theory is correct, my prediction would be, there should be minimal destruction in Jerusalem. Israel wants/wanted Jerusalem, and to be intact, not flatten. See the difference with Gaza Strip. 

7. What is Jerusalem worth ? Saladdin replied Nothing, then said Everything. I am not saying its historically accurate, i wanted to emphasize how people think. Jerusalem is worth nothing and everything. You wont want to destroy something that valuable. 

8. At the beginning of the Ukraine war, did you noticed the Russia’s attack was very tactical and calculated…lets attack the telecommunication system, military bases, military airbase, railway lines etc… I think at this moment, Putin really thought Ukraine was part of Russia, so he wasnt intending to flatten Ukraine. But Putin’s invasion plans didnt go as plan, F£*&amp; it… then Russia started to change tactic and started to obliterate cities like Bahmut, Mariupol, Kharkiv, etc... Well, if Putin cant have Ukraine, nobody else can…. might as well flatten it. 

9. Even if any US states try to secede from USA, the US military is unlikely going to flatten their cities. Because Washington would have concluded that is part of US land, we shouldnt cause that much destruction. Not to mention the bad press, criticism, protests, etc… the people there are American citizens and they might have family and friends in other parts of the USA. If its not US land, well… I can tell you the approach will be very different.

10. These intentions are not static, and can change. Trump probably has a few ideas of his own and will start making changes next year. Currently, there is rumors that part of Gaza Strip in the north might be turned into a buffer zone by IDF. I think the reason is for security purpose, not for the purpose to annex and not to settle in Gaza. And I dont think it will be permanent either.

Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence, who prevented holocaust survivors from seeking refuge in the British Mandate.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted. Please research the ways Palestinians are treated in Lebanon and Jordan, where they are banned from certain professions, from owning property, from having full citizenship, all so they can be used as a political tool to put pressure on Israel.

And that's the difference. Hamas is, to this day, an **active** terrorist organization. Irgun and Lehi were dismantled generations ago. Fateh stopped being a terrorist organization in the late 1980's, and by the 1990's it was removed from terrorist lists.

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.



Anyways, I could go on, but I think my general point has been made…

Daniela Weiss and her band of terrorists are going to keep pushing for settling Netzarim and Northern Gaza every day. These scum follow a rutual where they turn up at the Netzarim gates every morning, and they seem increasingly confident in interviews. I guess we'll see who is right.

My primary sources are Israel Hayom and Haaretz.

If you think Gaza belongs to you, your property, you would not have flatten much of Gaza. I still think the current top Israeli leadership also doesnt want to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip.

1. Ben-Gurion and early zionists may have commented on Greater Israel. But time has changed, the current top leadership is no Ben-Gurion. Similarly, Trump is no Biden. The government policies will change depending on the leader and changes with the time.

2. Daniella Weiss, Ben-Gvir, Smotrich and other extreme right wings may be salivating at the idea of re-establishing Gush Katif settlements (formerly near Khan Yunis) in the southern Gaza Strip. But none of them were part of the former top Israeli war cabinet, and even currently they do not direct or lead the war. They may try, but this is not official government policy. 

I am trying to explain that is/was not the intention of Israel/IDF to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip. It’s kinda an ancient war maxime (idk what is it called), but you dont destroy the land/ all the buildings if you want to conquer itand considered that land belongs to you.

3. During WW2, Germany didnt destroy Paris. They tried when they were losing and evacuating, but not at the start. They wanted Paris to be intact. And you would too if you are conquering Paris. There is a suggestion (some might dispute it) that the German leader who cannot be named during WW2, did not REALLY wanted to conquer Britain. After defeating France, Germany thought Britain would make peace. There were lots of destruction during the Battle of Britain especially London.

4. US dropped nuclear bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, flatten them. US had no intention of permanently conquering Japan. US never saw Japan as part of US land. US wanted to end the war, and thought using nuclear bomb will do that, and it did, Japan surrendered. US was in Japan for a bit to sort things out then quickly handed over to a transitional Japanese government. US had no intention of conquering Japan.

5. US dropped more than 7.5 million tons of bombs in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. US had no intention of permanently conquering Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos. It’s easier to completely destroy something you dont want/need and even easier if you are not the one going to clean up the mess later down the line. See the pattern….Israel has no intention of funding the rebuilding of Gaza with Israeli money. But that doesnt mean Israel will prevent others from funding the rebuilding of Gaza, mainly from donations from USA, Europe, Arab, Muslim countries and rest of international world but not Israel.

6. I dont have the facts, can someone check how was the six days war fought in Jerusalem ? If my theory is correct, my prediction would be, there should be minimal destruction in Jerusalem. Israel wants/wanted Jerusalem, and to be intact, not flatten. See the difference with Gaza Strip. 

7. What is Jerusalem worth ? Saladdin replied Nothing, then said Everything. I am not saying its historically accurate, i wanted to emphasize how people think. Jerusalem is worth nothing and everything. You wont want to destroy something that valuable. 

8. At the beginning of the Ukraine war, did you noticed the Russia’s attack was very tactical and calculated…lets attack the telecommunication system, military bases, military airbase, railway lines etc… I think at this moment, Putin really thought Ukraine was part of Russia, so he wasnt intending to flatten Ukraine. But Putin’s invasion plans didnt go as plan, F£*&amp; it… then Russia started to change tactic and started to obliterate cities like Bahmut, Mariupol, Kharkiv, etc... Well, if Putin cant have Ukraine, nobody else can…. might as well flatten it. 

9. Even if any US states try to secede from USA, the US military is unlikely going to flatten their cities. Because Washington would have concluded that is part of US land, we shouldnt cause that much destruction. Not to mention the bad press, criticism, protests, etc… the people there are American citizens and they might have family and friends in other parts of the USA. If its not US land, well… I can tell you the approach will be very different.

10. These intentions are not static, and can change. Trump probably has a few ideas of his own and will start making changes next year. Currently, there is rumors that part of Gaza Strip in the north might be turned into a buffer zone by IDF. I think the reason is for security purpose, not for the purpose to annex and not to settle in Gaza. And I dont think it will be permanent either.

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

While I can totally agree with you that the Palestinians need to make peace with the idea of acknowledging the right of Israel to exist as a state / homeland for the Jewish people, I disagree with almost everything else you’ve said in your response.

The settlements are not a minor issue the way you claim, they’re a major issue because they indicate more clearly than anything else what Israel’s long-term intentions are with regard to the Palestinian dream of nationhood, which most Israelis presently seem to want to obliterate just as surely as Palestinians themselves have dreamed of obliterating Israeli nationhood.   As I stated in my earlier post, no serious person believes - and I honestly suspect this includes most Israelis themselves - that Israel intends to withdraw via negotiations ten or twenty or thirty years from now from territories where it’s now settled half a million people - the cost and logistics of such a withdrawal let alone the associated public relations optics would be utterly insupportable compared with those of the 9,000-settler 2005 withdrawal from Gaza.   Again, any serious person would assume these are meant to be permanent acquisitions, and that Israel’s goal here, whatever its government’s rhetoric, is indeed a land grab.

And no, the fact that the acreage on which these settlements stand is relatively small means nothing here.   Towns and cities definitionally depend on roads and hinterland to supply them with water, power, trade, defense, and all other economic means of survival, and Israel manifestly has no intention of giving up any of those.   That is precisely why the tens of thousands of Palestinians currently living in area C (61% of the West Bank) are rarely if ever permitted to expand housing (despite “natural population increase”, which is routinely allowed for Jewish settlers to expand theirs) or otherwise utilize 95%+ of the non-urban land for economic purposes, whilst no restrictions of any kind are placed on the settlers.

Moving on, there is in fact presently NO nation anywhere on Earth composed of 165 non-contiguous discrete enclaves as is the case with areas A and B on the West Bank.   And your statement that there are “many nations” nowadays with enclaves / exclaves is in fact very false - there are extremely few modern-day nations of that kind, and in the cases of those that do exist, such as Belgium or Switzerland or Germany or Azerbaijan, the exclaves are generally minute in size compared to the “main body” of the nation in question, generally consisting of a single village or even just a few buildings - Nakhichevan strikes me as the sole sizable exception in that regard, and it’s the SINGLE sizeable exclave of Azerbaijan.  

Looking at maps, that is manifestly not what Israel seems to have in mind for the Palestinian areas of the West Bank.

The “archipelago nation” analogy in the meantime is absurd.   Such nations, if they’re considered to be truly sovereign in their international relations, definitionally control the waterways that separate their islands.   That would obviously not be the case with your envisioned Palestine consisting of dozens if not 165 discontiguous parcels of land separated from each other by territory controlled by the IDF.   Again, no serious person would view Indonesia or the Philippines as truly sovereign independent nations if control of the waterways between their many islands had been ceded to, say, China or the U.S.

You’re a very vigorous and eloquent defender of Israel and a generation or so ago I might have agreed with you that responsibility for the present impasse was more or less entirely due to the Palestinians’ intransigence when Israel offered them reasonable concessions.   But the settlements more than anything else have made it clear to me what Israel’s long-term objective really is, and it really doesn’t seem to be “peaceful co-existence” alongside an independent Palestinian homeland anymore.  The goal has become to pen the Palestinians into small, nonviable, discontiguous fragments of land where they can be easily controlled and perhaps eventually given some sort of symbolic window dressing of political autonomy, in an effort to fool the rest of us in foreign countries into believing that their dream of a truly free and prosperous independent future has been fulfilled.

On the first day of Israel claiming sovereignty, it was the Arab league that attacked, and failed. As there has been no official cessation of hostilities since then, it's been an ongoing war for 80 years, and thus thus it should be Arab who foots the bill being the instigator.",IsraelPalestine,12/2/2024 23:51,1h50qrx,OddShelter5543,0,1,0,True,6/16/2024 19:46,0,0,1,2215,2216,19,"During World War II, several Arab leaders, including the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Amin al-Husseini, forged strong ties with Nazi Germany. Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

It seems fighting is still continuing by Israelis against Hezbollah.   

As far as I know, Israel couldn't negotiate a deal to end hezbollah but instead negotiated a deal to only move hezbollah north of the litani and not allow new weapon supplies, but it did not mention any ideas of disarming hezbollah north of the litani. This was the ceasefire terms agreed upon both sides.   

While it would have been better for Lebanese and for Israelis to have a deal ensuring disarming Hezbollah as a foreign backed militia in Lebanon, this was not the deal Israel was achieved.   

Ever since the ceasefire, Israel has continued attacks on what it claims are hezbollah targets, but they are doing so even north of the Litani river where the deal that both sides agreed to did not mention that hezbollah can't operate there.   

I'm afraid this will do nothing but put anyone who opposes hezbollah from the Lebanese side in a bad position because this would only prove that you can't trust israeli ceasefires and terms. This will only give hezbollah more reasons to remain legitimate and will dismiss any Lebanese efforts to take control.

&gt; Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites along Syria's border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said Saturday, testing a fragile, days-old ceasefire that has seen continued sporadic fire.

&gt; The military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria into Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect, which the military said was a violation of its terms. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities or Hezbollah.

Hezbollah smuggling arms is a clear violation of ceasefire terms

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence, who prevented holocaust survivors from seeking refuge in the British Mandate.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted. Please research the ways Palestinians are treated in Lebanon and Jordan, where they are banned from certain professions, from owning property, from having full citizenship, all so they can be used as a political tool to put pressure on Israel.

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.

Anti Zionism is not the same as antisemitism. If you’re antisemitic, you’re a bigot. If your anti Zionist, you believe the people of Palestine are entitled to live and worship in their ancestral land without the oppression and thievery and murder  by a genocidal regime that showed up less than a century ago. 

Zionism is fundamentally flawed because it prioritizes the creation of a Jewish state over the rights of the indigenous Palestinian population, resulting in the theft of their land and resources. The establishment of Israel in 1948 was marked by the forced displacement of over 700,000 Palestinians during the Nakba where entire villages were destroyed, and Palestinians were stripped of their homes, heritage, and livelihoods. This dispossession continues today through the expansion of settlements, land confiscations, and discriminatory policies that further erode Palestinian sovereignty. Critics argue that Zionism institutionalizes these injustices by privileging one group’s national aspirations over the rights of another group that has lived on the land for centuries. Anti-Zionism, therefore, is a rejection of the colonial framework that justifies the erasure of indigenous people and their history.
   
Supporting Jewish people’s right to practice their religion does not require endorsing a political ideology rooted in the theft of indigenous land. Zionism’s reliance on displacement and systemic inequality makes it incompatible with principles of justice, human rights, and coexistence. Anti-Zionism challenges this framework, advocating instead for a future where all people in the region—Jews, Palestinians, and others—can live with equal rights, dignity, and sovereignty. By critiquing Zionism, we stand against the dispossession of indigenous populations and affirm the necessity of a just and inclusive solution that respects the rights of all communities.",IsraelPalestine,12/3/2024 3:49,1h4mvic,might_be_magic,1,1,0,True,2/21/2019 20:00,2182,39,24401,6573,33195,59,"I grew up for 40 years thinking mass antisemitism was a thing of the past.

I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

People deny this is rooted in antisemitism and I want to believe they’re accurate, but in our community, we just can’t come up with any other reason! So if you are Anti-Zionist, what do you think Zionism is? Do we not have the right to self define? Is the definition offensive to you?

I know the general idea was to create a place where Jews would be safe, and I suppose that's the main reason to keep a Jewish majority. 

But are there other reasons?  Maybe some scriptural basis for needing to be majority Jewish?  I can't find any so far.  There's certainly a scriptural basis for the idea of Jews having a *connection* to the land of Israel, but there's nothing I've found in the Jewish tradition/scriture that says Jews need to be in the majority. 

Or maybe something totally different? I know Israel was *planned* as a Jewish state by the UN partition plan, same as Pakistan was planned as a Muslim state.. 

I'm not challenging the idea that it should be majority Jewish. (There's basically no such thing as a state whose native ethnic people has not remained in the majority -- France, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Germany, especially Japan, etc., all remain something like 85%-95% ethnically homogeneous.  So I don't see anything strange about Jews being the majority in Israel.) 

So I'm not asking ""why"" as a way to criticize Israel.  I'm searching for all the possible reasons why any stakeholders want to keep it majority Jewish.  

I also have a followup question:  What was the reason for Zionists wanting a Jewish majority when they established Israel?  Same as above, I know the obvious reasons for not wanting to be outnumbered by hostiles.  I'm trying to find any *other* reasons.

Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

For one, countless anaylsts, including those in Israel have commented that Israel has already lost the war. And that it cannot beat Hamas or the Palestinian Joint-Operations Room.

[As early as last month,](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/israel-losing-netanyahu-wont-back-down-his-war-aims) the British defence think tank reported that:

&gt; Israel is not achieving its war aims against Hamas. First, it has only obtained a handful of the hostages. Some have been killed; the fates of many others are still unknown.

Second, Hamas has not been destroyed. Destruction of a terrorist organisation is difficult to measure. Some point to leadership decapitation. However, as Jenna Jordan has pointed out, attriting terrorist leaders seldom brings about their organisations’ collapse. Factors such as popular support, ideology and organisational structure play bigger roles in deciding these groups’ fates. Another measure used to determine if a terrorist group has been destroyed is if its territorial sphere has been reduced or removed. Israel has failed to deprive Hamas of the territory it governed prior to the war. Hamas has been battered in Gaza, but it is still a political force to be reckoned with. Unaffiliated Palestinian clans have refused to join in a post-war reconstruction effort for fear of retaliation by Hamas. Third, Israel has not been able to secure its borders. While it has regained control over some border crossings, the underground infrastructure that has allowed Hamas to engage in smuggling weapons and carrying out attacks is still in place.

[Analdou Agency reported that a former Mossad chief had stated that Israel was unequovically losing the war in Gaza.](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-on-losing-end-in-gaza-war-former-mossad-deputy-chief/3223179). Even Zionist publishers like [JP reported this](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-803955).

[As CNN has reported, Hamas has remained wholly combat effective.](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/08/middleeast/gaza-israel-hamas-battalions-invs-intl/). This is a pattern that staretd early in the war. By December, the IDF was declaring most Hamas batallions to have been dismantled.

This was quickly revealed to be a propaganda lie. As in early 2024, reports emerged that Hamas had begun rehabilitating its batallions in North Gaza. Reports from the Neo-Conservative think tank isw argued that as much as 80% of Hamas' fighting strength was restored. 

According to the isw's report on MArch 27th, they argue that this means Palestinian fighters ""retain  significant degree of combat effectiveness in the area, despite continued Israeli clearing efforts around Gaza City."" and that ""The return of Israeli forces to [Zaytoun] suggests that Palestinian militias continue to operate there similar to how these militias still have a presence in other portions of the northern Gaza Strip.""

We can also check pretty much every battle in Gaza to see how this is true.

The first battle in Gaza was the battle of Beit Hanoun. Despite IDF claims, they never occupied the city. And the battle is considered as having ended in a Palestinian victory. The isw reported that when the IDF left in December, the P-JOR continued effective control over Beit Hanoun. Beit Hanoun was used as a base to attack the IDF and send rockets into Israel, demonstrating that teh IDF had failed to defeat the JOR in Beit Hanoun.

Then we have the First Battle of Jabalia. As the isw reported, Hamas retained control of Jabalia after Israel withdrew in May. 

&gt; ""These points taken together reflect the degree to which Hamas and other Palestinian militias remain combat effective in and around Jabalia. Hamas and the other militias will almost certainly resume their efforts to reconstitute there as the IDF units have left.""

Then we have the Battle of Shuja'iyya. Though the IDF declared victory here, heavy casualties forced them to withdraw and as al-Jazeera reported, Palestinians retained control of the city. Further evidence of Palestinain control is that several months later, the IDF returned to the region to try and wrestle control away from the JOR.

This 2nd battle was just as disastrous for the IDF. After retreating in July, Hamas and the PIJ retained dominance in the city. Again, al-Jazeera reported how this had occured. But not stopping there, when the IDF withdrew in videos from the area one could see Palestinian militants with guns in their hands standing around in broad daylight. Alongside this, government officials working for the P-JOR immediately remerged in the city, as if they had never left, and reasserted doubly Palestinian control in the region.

Then we have the siege of Khan Yunis. The first Israeli assualt ended in abject failure. so great was the routing of the IDF they withdrew from all of southern Gaza. Khan Yunis itself remained under the control of the Joint Operations Room. Again, as reported by the isw. The 2nd and 3rd battles ended in much the same way and in far shorter timespans.

Then comes al-Qarara. By all acounts, a Palestinian victory.The isw reported that Israel was defeated in al-Qarara. They had failed to achieve any of their aims. P-JOR remained in control. No high ranking militants were found or killed, and accordinng to anaylsts, Hamas remained combat effective in the region.

This is how every battle that has ended thus far has gone. Israel went in, killed civilians for a few weeks. Ran into resistance, tried to fight back, upon seeing heavy casualties retreated with Palestine still in control.

This is not what victory looks like. Israel is, by all measures losing.","The evidence that Hamas is in fact, beating the IDF in Gaza",0.18,0,0,11/30/2024 16:33,0.0,Neutral

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.

I am referring to the MoH numbers regarding identified bodies which is over 40,000 people. If you go looking for statistical anomalies in a large data set you can find them.

You argue that the death totals in Gaza are exaggerated and then promptly follow that up with an inflated number of deaths during the disgusting Oct 7 attack. 1,139 is not ""around 1,500"".

Again. If a Jewish majority state treats you the way Israel treats the Palestinians it is simple human nature to take issue with those people. Expecting anything different is downright childish.

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally.

I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

Most I hadn’t even heard of, but why no focus on the conflicts and genocide in Sudan where 25 million people need humanitarian aid and 12 million have been displaced? Why is the focus on Ukraine minimal when it is one if the most despicable wars ever with the potential of the collapse of Western society? 

People deny this is rooted in antisemitism and I want to believe they’re accurate, but in our community, we just can’t come up with any other reason! So if you are Anti-Zionist, what do you think Zionism is? Do we not have the right to self define? Is the definition offensive to you? And why is this conflict so important to you if you aren’t Jewish, Israeli, Palestinian, Iranian, Muslim etc? Why not other conflicts?

696,m058nor,1,"Anyone who thinks a few steps beyond the memes, infographs, dogma du jour at the unis, knows the Arabs/Hamas/Hezbollah would genocide all the Jews if they could. If they had the power/weaponry. *They've stated this over and over and over.* One side has better guns; that's it. Ideologically, they are likely more genocidal than the IDF/Lakud who, according to everything I've read, are still giving evacuation orders rather than just dropping bombs out of nowhere - at least, they try. Hamas gave no warnings on 10/7.

I'm sure there are some inhumane IDF soldier jerkoffs, as there are in any war. I'm not even saying the IDF/Israel is more noble than Arabs/Palestine. However to act as though Palestinians/Arabs are angels and Israelis/US is evil is utterly, utterly absurd. To call it ""settler colonialism"" when Jews are indigenous to Israel makes literally no sense.

The conflict is tragic, it's true. The UN partition was a crap deal for the Palestinians to a degree, and everything wasn't on the up and up. OK, fine. Go tell that to the history of history, which is brutal wars of conquest literally everywhere. The Palestinians were displaced in the Nakba. OK, but the Arabs launched a war first. And Palestinians weren't genocided. The Armenians were genocided by the Ottomans and the survivors were marched into the Syrian desert to die or to be displaced. Guess what? The Armenians didn't start death cults and terrorist groups to murder, rape, behead incident Turkish civilians. They lost tons of land. There is no right to return. They got their sh\*te together and moved on and got rich in the US.

This, team TikTok, is the history of history. Why are Palestinians allowed to brutally terrorize Israeli citizens 75+ years later? Does team TikTok and the US know world history - or even actual *current* geopolitics? Do they know that wars of conquests and displacement happens and that the victims move on? And where are the American leftists shouting about all the Afghans the Pakistanis kicked out a few months ago, or the Armenians ethnically cleansed out of Nagorno Karabakh in 2023.

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally.

Had the Arab League not invaded in a war of extermination, there would be displacement but nowhere near that amount, and half of the 700k that were displaced were not forcible displacement but from the Arab League telling them to leave for the war, and others out of fear. Had the Arabs also accepted their state it still would’ve been even less as it would’ve been much swapping of Jewish and Arab villages as they both formed their new states side by side. 

Why would Germany be giving their land? Do you think Zionism started in 1945? Modern Zionism movement was from the late 1800s, even Hebrew University was formed by Albert Einstein back in 1918, but proposed in 1884 during the modern Zionism movement. Were Jews only persecuted in WW2 or was it millennia of persecution and forced expulsion? 

It would be entirely unreasonable for Germany to be forced to take on all the Jews that had migrated and been forced out for the centuries prior to WW2. 

Why do you think the Hebron Massacre happened in the 1920s if Zionism movement of fleeing persecution for safety is somehow about being post-1945?

I’d still like to believe that but much of what has happened in response to this conflict makes that hard. I’m not getting why,if not for antisemitism, are people are so anti-Zionist and why this conflict is so focussed on. I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement? 

And this isn’t the only conflict in the world. It’s not even the largest by people killed or involved. Here is a map that shows all current conflicts. https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker 

Most I hadn’t even heard of, but why no focus on the conflicts and genocide in Sudan where 25 million people need humanitarian aid and 12 million have been displaced? Why is the focus on Ukraine minimal when it is one if the most despicable wars ever with the potential of the collapse of Western society? 

People deny this is rooted in antisemitism and I want to believe they’re accurate, but in our community, we just can’t come up with any other reason! So if you are Anti-Zionist, what do you think Zionism is? Do we not have the right to self define? Is the definition offensive to you? And why is this conflict so important to you if you aren’t Jewish, Israeli, Palestinian, Iranian, Muslim etc? Why not other conflicts?

109,m06oyk5,1,"There are honest answers as to why those terms are used, and there are the ones given in 99% of cases. The honest answers go like this:

'Settler-Colonial' - while Jews indeed were a community in Palestine for thousands of years, it is also undeniable that the Zionist movement included, by the vast majority, Ashkenazi Jews from Western and Eastern Europe, with the influx of those populations being perceived, understandably so, as a colonial effort by some vague Western power. Was it? Not really, there was no Metropol to speak of, no nation that established a colony in a classical understanding. Was there a movement of European Jews moving into Palestine and settling there? Yes, of course, it's a historical fact. Whether it's appropriate to call it a ""settler-colonial"" venture is debatable and really depends on the person's understanding of that term. The later influx of Mizrahim, Middle-Eastern Jews, in even larger numbers paints this situation differently as well, but I wouldn't necessarily call that part of the directed Zionist effort the same way it was with the European Jews.

""Ethnostate"" - people have a natural aversion to the concept, since it assumes, and necessarily includes some manner of ethnic discrimination in an effort to maintain the majority of a single group. Nobody likes ethnicity-based discrimination for understandable reasons. But, there are also historical realities like the entire Middle East being almost exclusively Ethnostates, whether implicitly or explicitly, and the existence of very understandable justifications for the continuous maintenance of a Jewish demographic majority in a state built for Jews, by Jews, or other justifications for such practices that would be accepted by reasonable people.

The answers given most often however are boring and come from a place of anti-semitism, or obsession with power dynamics, or plain foolishness and lack of understanding of the concepts. Anything with the word ""colonial"" is assumed to be evil incarnate, an Imperial force dominating indigenous people, stealing their natural resources and land, and treating them as 2nd class citisens, if not outright cleansing them. And anything that is ""ethnostate"" is assumed to be a similarly evil thing that is inherently racist and has nazi-esque vibes.",IsraelPalestine,12/3/2024 11:31,1h5k8xu,Twytilus,0,1,0,True,10/3/2020 21:30,183,0,10844,33064,44091,12,"'Settler-Colonial' implies that people moved to the region by choice and displaced the indigenous population. Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence, who prevented holocaust survivors from seeking refuge in the British Mandate.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted. Please research the ways Palestinians are treated in Lebanon and Jordan, where they are banned from certain professions, from owning property, from having full citizenship, all so they can be used as a political tool to put pressure on Israel.

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.

[As early as last month,](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/israel-losing-netanyahu-wont-back-down-his-war-aims) the British defence think tank reported that:

Second, Hamas has not been destroyed. Destruction of a terrorist organisation is difficult to measure. Some point to leadership decapitation. However, as Jenna Jordan has pointed out, attriting terrorist leaders seldom brings about their organisations’ collapse. Factors such as popular support, ideology and organisational structure play bigger roles in deciding these groups’ fates. Another measure used to determine if a terrorist group has been destroyed is if its territorial sphere has been reduced or removed. Israel has failed to deprive Hamas of the territory it governed prior to the war. Hamas has been battered in Gaza, but it is still a political force to be reckoned with. Unaffiliated Palestinian clans have refused to join in a post-war reconstruction effort for fear of retaliation by Hamas. Third, Israel has not been able to secure its borders. While it has regained control over some border crossings, the underground infrastructure that has allowed Hamas to engage in smuggling weapons and carrying out attacks is still in place.

[Analdou Agency reported that a former Mossad chief had stated that Israel was unequovically losing the war in Gaza.](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-on-losing-end-in-gaza-war-former-mossad-deputy-chief/3223179). Even Zionist publishers like [JP reported this](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-803955).

[As CNN has reported, Hamas has remained wholly combat effective.](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/08/middleeast/gaza-israel-hamas-battalions-invs-intl/). This is a pattern that staretd early in the war. By December, the IDF was declaring most Hamas batallions to have been dismantled.

This was quickly revealed to be a propaganda lie. As in early 2024, reports emerged that Hamas had begun rehabilitating its batallions in North Gaza. Reports from the Neo-Conservative think tank isw argued that as much as 80% of Hamas' fighting strength was restored. 

According to the isw's report on MArch 27th, they argue that this means Palestinian fighters ""retain  significant degree of combat effectiveness in the area, despite continued Israeli clearing efforts around Gaza City."" and that ""The return of Israeli forces to [Zaytoun] suggests that Palestinian militias continue to operate there similar to how these militias still have a presence in other portions of the northern Gaza Strip.""

We can also check pretty much every battle in Gaza to see how this is true.

The first battle in Gaza was the battle of Beit Hanoun. Despite IDF claims, they never occupied the city. And the battle is considered as having ended in a Palestinian victory. The isw reported that when the IDF left in December, the P-JOR continued effective control over Beit Hanoun. Beit Hanoun was used as a base to attack the IDF and send rockets into Israel, demonstrating that teh IDF had failed to defeat the JOR in Beit Hanoun.

Then we have the First Battle of Jabalia. As the isw reported, Hamas retained control of Jabalia after Israel withdrew in May. 

&gt; ""These points taken together reflect the degree to which Hamas and other Palestinian militias remain combat effective in and around Jabalia. Hamas and the other militias will almost certainly resume their efforts to reconstitute there as the IDF units have left.""

Then we have the Battle of Shuja'iyya. Though the IDF declared victory here, heavy casualties forced them to withdraw and as al-Jazeera reported, Palestinians retained control of the city. Further evidence of Palestinain control is that several months later, the IDF returned to the region to try and wrestle control away from the JOR.

This 2nd battle was just as disastrous for the IDF. After retreating in July, Hamas and the PIJ retained dominance in the city. Again, al-Jazeera reported how this had occured. But not stopping there, when the IDF withdrew in videos from the area one could see Palestinian militants with guns in their hands standing around in broad daylight. Alongside this, government officials working for the P-JOR immediately remerged in the city, as if they had never left, and reasserted doubly Palestinian control in the region.

Then we have the siege of Khan Yunis. The first Israeli assualt ended in abject failure. so great was the routing of the IDF they withdrew from all of southern Gaza. Khan Yunis itself remained under the control of the Joint Operations Room. Again, as reported by the isw. The 2nd and 3rd battles ended in much the same way and in far shorter timespans.

Then comes al-Qarara. By all acounts, a Palestinian victory.The isw reported that Israel was defeated in al-Qarara. They had failed to achieve any of their aims. P-JOR remained in control. No high ranking militants were found or killed, and accordinng to anaylsts, Hamas remained combat effective in the region.

This is how every battle that has ended thus far has gone. Israel went in, killed civilians for a few weeks. Ran into resistance, tried to fight back, upon seeing heavy casualties retreated with Palestine still in control.

This is not what victory looks like. Israel is, by all measures losing.","The evidence that Hamas is in fact, beating the IDF in Gaza",0.18,0,0,11/30/2024 16:33,1.0,Pro-Israel

There's certainly a scriptural basis for the idea of Jews having a *connection* to the land of Israel, but there's nothing I've found in the Jewish tradition/scriture that says Jews need to be in the majority. 

Or maybe something totally different? I know Israel was *planned* as a Jewish state by the UN partition plan, same as Pakistan was planned as a Muslim state.. 

I'm not challenging the idea that it should be majority Jewish.

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

771,m053hz7,1,"&gt;That’s a part-to-whole fallacy. 

No, that's majority vs minority opinion. 

The majority of pro-pal demonstrations are calling for ""from water to water Palestine will be arab"" (aka Jewish genocide), intifada (violence, terrorism, suicide bombings), slogans like ""Yemen Yemen make us proud, k*** another soldier now"", ""we are hamas"", or red triangles everywhere- which is both a holocaust symbol and how hamas marks its targets. 

Charming right?

Now. I'm not going to deny the khanists exit. But they are a fringe minority that everyone thinks is _nuts_

Otherwise the majority of pro-Israel protests are... singing Jewish songs. Peaceful ones. Some even named ""the song of peace"" or ""the hope""


&gt;You cannot simply project the disgusting actions of those antisemites onto genuine pro-Palestinians who are also supportive of their Jewish brothers.


Do they support the 90% of jews that are zionists? Or only the 10% of who they think are ""one of the good ones""

&gt;I wouldn’t cherry pick Islamophobic sentiments and behaviors from Zionists or pro-Israelis and come to the conclusion that “this implies pro-Israelis are inherently islamophobic”.

Except it's totally normal to be Muslim in Israel. You can year the call to prayer from countless mineret in almost every city. It's illegal to be Jewish in Gaza. It's not illegal, but dangerous in Ramallah. Jews are banned from the temple mount. 

And yes, I absolutely believe it is my job to call out Islamophobia in my movement. 

Instead of all the people who thought it was fine to have a guy in charge of the Columbia encampment who was threatening to ""murder every (((zionist))) everywhere"" for months

So you tell me which movement has a behavior problem? The pro-Israel hasn't broken into... any buildings that I know of, let alone dozens writing slurs and threats on the walls",IsraelPalestine,12/3/2024 2:44,1h4fkct,CastleElsinore,0,1,0,True,9/4/2014 3:42,43,0,2187,42819,45049,13,"Let me preface this by saying that my father is ethnically Jewish, and that roughly ten years ago, I studied Hebrew, read (bits of) the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, as well as Jewish writers such as Josephus and Philo Judaeus, with the plan being for me ultimately to convert to Judaism. I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.



Anyways, I could go on, but I think my general point has been made…

Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.

To be honest, while I wouldn't mind being wrong, I would not bet against them. Increasingly, I am viewing Israel with the same lens as I do the PRC. The PRC has been accused of and criticised by the West over many things, some of which I can draw parallel to Israel. Yet for all the criticisms, China still has enough leverage, militarily and economically (despite facing many troubles) to avoid severe consequences and  be really outed as a pariah (to me, it's not enough to condemn a country's action, but the country would need to be widely sanctioned internationally for me to affix that label).

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence, who prevented holocaust survivors from seeking refuge in the British Mandate.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted. Please research the ways Palestinians are treated in Lebanon and Jordan, where they are banned from certain professions, from owning property, from having full citizenship, all so they can be used as a political tool to put pressure on Israel.

This was the ceasefire terms agreed upon both sides.   

While it would have been better for Lebanese and for Israelis to have a deal ensuring disarming Hezbollah as a foreign backed militia in Lebanon, this was not the deal Israel was achieved.   

Ever since the ceasefire, Israel has continued attacks on what it claims are hezbollah targets, but they are doing so even north of the Litani river where the deal that both sides agreed to did not mention that hezbollah can't operate there.   

I'm afraid this will do nothing but put anyone who opposes hezbollah from the Lebanese side in a bad position because this would only prove that you can't trust israeli ceasefires and terms. This will only give hezbollah more reasons to remain legitimate and will dismiss any Lebanese efforts to take control.     
   
   
EDIT: From one of the replies:

[link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/israel-hezbollah-syria-ceasefire-gaza-world-central-kitchen/)

&gt; An Israeli airstrike on a car in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed five people, including employees of World Central Kitchen. The charity said it was ""urgently seeking more details"" after Israel's military said it targeted a WCK worker who was part of the Hamas attack that sparked the war.

&gt; Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites along Syria's border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said Saturday, testing a fragile, days-old ceasefire that has seen continued sporadic fire.

&gt; The military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria into Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect, which the military said was a violation of its terms. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities or Hezbollah.

Hezbollah smuggling arms is a clear violation of ceasefire terms

However, that does not explain why Israel has bombed a member of the Lebanese Army in the far north. They're also destroying random buildings in the south, that was not part of any agreement.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

I’d still like to believe that but much of what has happened in response to this conflict makes that hard. I’m not getting why,if not for antisemitism, are people are so anti-Zionist and why this conflict is so focussed on. I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement? 

And this isn’t the only conflict in the world. It’s not even the largest by people killed or involved. Here is a map that shows all current conflicts. https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker

Why is the focus on Ukraine minimal when it is one if the most despicable wars ever with the potential of the collapse of Western society? 

People deny this is rooted in antisemitism and I want to believe they’re accurate, but in our community, we just can’t come up with any other reason! So if you are Anti-Zionist, what do you think Zionism is? Do we not have the right to self define? Is the definition offensive to you?

Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence, who prevented holocaust survivors from seeking refuge in the British Mandate.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted. Please research the ways Palestinians are treated in Lebanon and Jordan, where they are banned from certain professions, from owning property, from having full citizenship, all so they can be used as a political tool to put pressure on Israel.

If you think Gaza belongs to you, your property, you would not have flatten much of Gaza. I still think the current top Israeli leadership also doesnt want to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip.

1. Ben-Gurion and early zionists may have commented on Greater Israel. But time has changed, the current top leadership is no Ben-Gurion. Similarly, Trump is no Biden. The government policies will change depending on the leader and changes with the time.

2. Daniella Weiss, Ben-Gvir, Smotrich and other extreme right wings may be salivating at the idea of re-establishing Gush Katif settlements (formerly near Khan Yunis) in the southern Gaza Strip. But none of them were part of the former top Israeli war cabinet, and even currently they do not direct or lead the war. They may try, but this is not official government policy. 

I am trying to explain that is/was not the intention of Israel/IDF to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip. It’s kinda an ancient war maxime (idk what is it called), but you dont destroy the land/ all the buildings if you want to conquer itand considered that land belongs to you.

3. During WW2, Germany didnt destroy Paris. They tried when they were losing and evacuating, but not at the start. They wanted Paris to be intact. And you would too if you are conquering Paris. There is a suggestion (some might dispute it) that the German leader who cannot be named during WW2, did not REALLY wanted to conquer Britain. After defeating France, Germany thought Britain would make peace. There were lots of destruction during the Battle of Britain especially London.

4. US dropped nuclear bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, flatten them. US had no intention of permanently conquering Japan. US never saw Japan as part of US land. US wanted to end the war, and thought using nuclear bomb will do that, and it did, Japan surrendered. US was in Japan for a bit to sort things out then quickly handed over to a transitional Japanese government. US had no intention of conquering Japan.

5. US dropped more than 7.5 million tons of bombs in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. US had no intention of permanently conquering Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos. It’s easier to completely destroy something you dont want/need and even easier if you are not the one going to clean up the mess later down the line. See the pattern….Israel has no intention of funding the rebuilding of Gaza with Israeli money. But that doesnt mean Israel will prevent others from funding the rebuilding of Gaza, mainly from donations from USA, Europe, Arab, Muslim countries and rest of international world but not Israel.

6. I dont have the facts, can someone check how was the six days war fought in Jerusalem ? If my theory is correct, my prediction would be, there should be minimal destruction in Jerusalem. Israel wants/wanted Jerusalem, and to be intact, not flatten. See the difference with Gaza Strip. 

7. What is Jerusalem worth ? Saladdin replied Nothing, then said Everything. I am not saying its historically accurate, i wanted to emphasize how people think. Jerusalem is worth nothing and everything. You wont want to destroy something that valuable. 

8. At the beginning of the Ukraine war, did you noticed the Russia’s attack was very tactical and calculated…lets attack the telecommunication system, military bases, military airbase, railway lines etc… I think at this moment, Putin really thought Ukraine was part of Russia, so he wasnt intending to flatten Ukraine. But Putin’s invasion plans didnt go as plan, F£*&amp; it… then Russia started to change tactic and started to obliterate cities like Bahmut, Mariupol, Kharkiv, etc... Well, if Putin cant have Ukraine, nobody else can…. might as well flatten it. 

9. Even if any US states try to secede from USA, the US military is unlikely going to flatten their cities. Because Washington would have concluded that is part of US land, we shouldnt cause that much destruction. Not to mention the bad press, criticism, protests, etc… the people there are American citizens and they might have family and friends in other parts of the USA. If its not US land, well… I can tell you the approach will be very different.

10. These intentions are not static, and can change. Trump probably has a few ideas of his own and will start making changes next year. Currently, there is rumors that part of Gaza Strip in the north might be turned into a buffer zone by IDF. I think the reason is for security purpose, not for the purpose to annex and not to settle in Gaza. And I dont think it will be permanent either.

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.



Anyways, I could go on, but I think my general point has been made…

[As early as last month,](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/israel-losing-netanyahu-wont-back-down-his-war-aims) the British defence think tank reported that:

&gt; Israel is not achieving its war aims against Hamas. First, it has only obtained a handful of the hostages. Some have been killed; the fates of many others are still unknown.

Second, Hamas has not been destroyed. Destruction of a terrorist organisation is difficult to measure. Some point to leadership decapitation. However, as Jenna Jordan has pointed out, attriting terrorist leaders seldom brings about their organisations’ collapse. Factors such as popular support, ideology and organisational structure play bigger roles in deciding these groups’ fates. Another measure used to determine if a terrorist group has been destroyed is if its territorial sphere has been reduced or removed. Israel has failed to deprive Hamas of the territory it governed prior to the war. Hamas has been battered in Gaza, but it is still a political force to be reckoned with. Unaffiliated Palestinian clans have refused to join in a post-war reconstruction effort for fear of retaliation by Hamas. Third, Israel has not been able to secure its borders. While it has regained control over some border crossings, the underground infrastructure that has allowed Hamas to engage in smuggling weapons and carrying out attacks is still in place.

[Analdou Agency reported that a former Mossad chief had stated that Israel was unequovically losing the war in Gaza.](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-on-losing-end-in-gaza-war-former-mossad-deputy-chief/3223179). Even Zionist publishers like [JP reported this](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-803955).

[As CNN has reported, Hamas has remained wholly combat effective.](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/08/middleeast/gaza-israel-hamas-battalions-invs-intl/). This is a pattern that staretd early in the war. By December, the IDF was declaring most Hamas batallions to have been dismantled.

This was quickly revealed to be a propaganda lie. As in early 2024, reports emerged that Hamas had begun rehabilitating its batallions in North Gaza. Reports from the Neo-Conservative think tank isw argued that as much as 80% of Hamas' fighting strength was restored. 

According to the isw's report on MArch 27th, they argue that this means Palestinian fighters ""retain  significant degree of combat effectiveness in the area, despite continued Israeli clearing efforts around Gaza City."" and that ""The return of Israeli forces to [Zaytoun] suggests that Palestinian militias continue to operate there similar to how these militias still have a presence in other portions of the northern Gaza Strip.""

We can also check pretty much every battle in Gaza to see how this is true.

The first battle in Gaza was the battle of Beit Hanoun. Despite IDF claims, they never occupied the city. And the battle is considered as having ended in a Palestinian victory. The isw reported that when the IDF left in December, the P-JOR continued effective control over Beit Hanoun. Beit Hanoun was used as a base to attack the IDF and send rockets into Israel, demonstrating that teh IDF had failed to defeat the JOR in Beit Hanoun.

Then we have the First Battle of Jabalia. As the isw reported, Hamas retained control of Jabalia after Israel withdrew in May. 

&gt; ""These points taken together reflect the degree to which Hamas and other Palestinian militias remain combat effective in and around Jabalia. Hamas and the other militias will almost certainly resume their efforts to reconstitute there as the IDF units have left.""

Then we have the Battle of Shuja'iyya. Though the IDF declared victory here, heavy casualties forced them to withdraw and as al-Jazeera reported, Palestinians retained control of the city. Further evidence of Palestinain control is that several months later, the IDF returned to the region to try and wrestle control away from the JOR.

This 2nd battle was just as disastrous for the IDF. After retreating in July, Hamas and the PIJ retained dominance in the city. Again, al-Jazeera reported how this had occured. But not stopping there, when the IDF withdrew in videos from the area one could see Palestinian militants with guns in their hands standing around in broad daylight. Alongside this, government officials working for the P-JOR immediately remerged in the city, as if they had never left, and reasserted doubly Palestinian control in the region.

Then we have the siege of Khan Yunis. The first Israeli assualt ended in abject failure. so great was the routing of the IDF they withdrew from all of southern Gaza. Khan Yunis itself remained under the control of the Joint Operations Room. Again, as reported by the isw. The 2nd and 3rd battles ended in much the same way and in far shorter timespans.

Then comes al-Qarara. By all acounts, a Palestinian victory.The isw reported that Israel was defeated in al-Qarara. They had failed to achieve any of their aims. P-JOR remained in control. No high ranking militants were found or killed, and accordinng to anaylsts, Hamas remained combat effective in the region.

This is how every battle that has ended thus far has gone. Israel went in, killed civilians for a few weeks. Ran into resistance, tried to fight back, upon seeing heavy casualties retreated with Palestine still in control.

&gt; Israel is not achieving its war aims against Hamas. First, it has only obtained a handful of the hostages. Some have been killed; the fates of many others are still unknown.

Second, Hamas has not been destroyed. Destruction of a terrorist organisation is difficult to measure. Some point to leadership decapitation. However, as Jenna Jordan has pointed out, attriting terrorist leaders seldom brings about their organisations’ collapse. Factors such as popular support, ideology and organisational structure play bigger roles in deciding these groups’ fates. Another measure used to determine if a terrorist group has been destroyed is if its territorial sphere has been reduced or removed. Israel has failed to deprive Hamas of the territory it governed prior to the war. Hamas has been battered in Gaza, but it is still a political force to be reckoned with. Unaffiliated Palestinian clans have refused to join in a post-war reconstruction effort for fear of retaliation by Hamas. Third, Israel has not been able to secure its borders. While it has regained control over some border crossings, the underground infrastructure that has allowed Hamas to engage in smuggling weapons and carrying out attacks is still in place.

[Analdou Agency reported that a former Mossad chief had stated that Israel was unequovically losing the war in Gaza.](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-on-losing-end-in-gaza-war-former-mossad-deputy-chief/3223179). Even Zionist publishers like [JP reported this](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-803955).

[As CNN has reported, Hamas has remained wholly combat effective.](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/08/middleeast/gaza-israel-hamas-battalions-invs-intl/). This is a pattern that staretd early in the war. By December, the IDF was declaring most Hamas batallions to have been dismantled.

This was quickly revealed to be a propaganda lie. As in early 2024, reports emerged that Hamas had begun rehabilitating its batallions in North Gaza. Reports from the Neo-Conservative think tank isw argued that as much as 80% of Hamas' fighting strength was restored. 

According to the isw's report on MArch 27th, they argue that this means Palestinian fighters ""retain  significant degree of combat effectiveness in the area, despite continued Israeli clearing efforts around Gaza City."" and that ""The return of Israeli forces to [Zaytoun] suggests that Palestinian militias continue to operate there similar to how these militias still have a presence in other portions of the northern Gaza Strip.""

We can also check pretty much every battle in Gaza to see how this is true.

The first battle in Gaza was the battle of Beit Hanoun. Despite IDF claims, they never occupied the city. And the battle is considered as having ended in a Palestinian victory. The isw reported that when the IDF left in December, the P-JOR continued effective control over Beit Hanoun. Beit Hanoun was used as a base to attack the IDF and send rockets into Israel, demonstrating that teh IDF had failed to defeat the JOR in Beit Hanoun.

Then we have the First Battle of Jabalia. As the isw reported, Hamas retained control of Jabalia after Israel withdrew in May. 

&gt; ""These points taken together reflect the degree to which Hamas and other Palestinian militias remain combat effective in and around Jabalia. Hamas and the other militias will almost certainly resume their efforts to reconstitute there as the IDF units have left.""

Then we have the Battle of Shuja'iyya. Though the IDF declared victory here, heavy casualties forced them to withdraw and as al-Jazeera reported, Palestinians retained control of the city. Further evidence of Palestinain control is that several months later, the IDF returned to the region to try and wrestle control away from the JOR.

This 2nd battle was just as disastrous for the IDF. After retreating in July, Hamas and the PIJ retained dominance in the city. Again, al-Jazeera reported how this had occured. But not stopping there, when the IDF withdrew in videos from the area one could see Palestinian militants with guns in their hands standing around in broad daylight. Alongside this, government officials working for the P-JOR immediately remerged in the city, as if they had never left, and reasserted doubly Palestinian control in the region.

Then we have the siege of Khan Yunis. The first Israeli assualt ended in abject failure. so great was the routing of the IDF they withdrew from all of southern Gaza. Khan Yunis itself remained under the control of the Joint Operations Room. Again, as reported by the isw. The 2nd and 3rd battles ended in much the same way and in far shorter timespans.

Then comes al-Qarara. By all acounts, a Palestinian victory.The isw reported that Israel was defeated in al-Qarara. They had failed to achieve any of their aims. P-JOR remained in control. No high ranking militants were found or killed, and accordinng to anaylsts, Hamas remained combat effective in the region.

This is how every battle that has ended thus far has gone. Israel went in, killed civilians for a few weeks. Ran into resistance, tried to fight back, upon seeing heavy casualties retreated with Palestine still in control.

This is not what victory looks like. Israel is, by all measures losing.","The evidence that Hamas is in fact, beating the IDF in Gaza",0.18,0,0,11/30/2024 16:33,0.0,Neutral

When your pitch starts with such asinine lying as this, it's not difficult to understand why no one takes you lot seriously.  [Here's](https://fb.watch/wdKRsLID1X/) a look at that 'cage'.   And [another](https://www.instagram.com/p/C_XcJrONuSM/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==).

&gt;… killed tens of thousands of civilians in the last 14 months

We know that the death figures are completely fabricated.  [Here](https://fathomjournal.org/statistically-impossible-a-critical-analysis-of-hamass-women-and-children-casualty-figures/) is a clue as to how they do it.  [Here's](https://x.com/Aizenberg55/status/1731753062622982386) another.    You can swallow the lies from the Hamas 'Health Ministry' all you like, but it's worth remembering that even if their figures were 100% accurate, no one asked them to invade Israel and slaughter around 1,500 innocents.   They decided that all on their own.  Maybe doing so wasn't the smartest thing that they've ever done.  What did they expect would be Israel's response?   The answer is that they knew that Israel would come after them, and hard.  They knew that people would die on both sides, and they knew that within a couple of days of Israel's response, the West would forget why the war had started, and would start to whine about 'innocent casualties'.

&gt;

Blowing people's loved ones up is not a good way to make friends.

My God, the *irony*!

&gt;You say you aren't dehumanizing them and then reduce a population of millions to simply being terrorists. That is reductive and denies the individuality of Palestinians which is dehumanizing

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally.

Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence, who prevented holocaust survivors from seeking refuge in the British Mandate.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted. Please research the ways Palestinians are treated in Lebanon and Jordan, where they are banned from certain professions, from owning property, from having full citizenship, all so they can be used as a political tool to put pressure on Israel.

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

I’d still like to believe that but much of what has happened in response to this conflict makes that hard. I’m not getting why,if not for antisemitism, are people are so anti-Zionist and why this conflict is so focussed on. I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement? 

And this isn’t the only conflict in the world. It’s not even the largest by people killed or involved. Here is a map that shows all current conflicts. https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker 

Most I hadn’t even heard of, but why no focus on the conflicts and genocide in Sudan where 25 million people need humanitarian aid and 12 million have been displaced? Why is the focus on Ukraine minimal when it is one if the most despicable wars ever with the potential of the collapse of Western society? 

People deny this is rooted in antisemitism and I want to believe they’re accurate, but in our community, we just can’t come up with any other reason! So if you are Anti-Zionist, what do you think Zionism is? Do we not have the right to self define? Is the definition offensive to you? And why is this conflict so important to you if you aren’t Jewish, Israeli, Palestinian, Iranian, Muslim etc? Why not other conflicts?

Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence, who prevented holocaust survivors from seeking refuge in the British Mandate.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted. Please research the ways Palestinians are treated in Lebanon and Jordan, where they are banned from certain professions, from owning property, from having full citizenship, all so they can be used as a political tool to put pressure on Israel.

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.



Anyways, I could go on, but I think my general point has been made…

859,m04sch4,1,"Also, your entire comment is a typically liberal(if Israel has any left) kumbaya delusion.  Since you think Daniella Weiss and her terrorist cult are toothless and powerless, you must not know any Israeli history.

How did the settlement of West Bank start? After the national joy of the blitzkrieg 1968 win by Israel, entire groups of fanatics seized on a Manifest Destiny Message from God and went and settled in the wilderness in West Bank (Area C, ""Judea &amp; Samaria""). The Israeli govt called them illegal, provided no support but they *still* went and occupied WB in increasing numbers every year till the govt of Menachem whatsis-fk finally legalized them and now it is the biggest subsidy drain on the Israeli (and American) taxpayers other than the wastrel Haredim. 

So again, in light of the recent history of Israel, I am going to trust the fanaticism of Mrs Weiss and her terrorists far more than a hopeful yet clueless Israeli liberal. No offense intended. Mrs Weiss, while a well-spoken fanatic, is far more realistic of her capabilities than the ""liberals"" who seem untethered from reality.",IsraelPalestine,12/3/2024 1:36,1h42p22,aetherks,0,1,0,True,12/24/2017 18:15,0,0,1,-48,-47,1,"My argument is if the former top Israel war cabinet had considered all of Gaza Strip to be part of Israeli land (some call it Greater Israel ), then it would not have flatten much of Gaza. If you think Gaza belongs to you, your property, you would not have flatten much of Gaza. I still think the current top Israeli leadership also doesnt want to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip.

1. Ben-Gurion and early zionists may have commented on Greater Israel. But time has changed, the current top leadership is no Ben-Gurion. Similarly, Trump is no Biden. The government policies will change depending on the leader and changes with the time.

2. Daniella Weiss, Ben-Gvir, Smotrich and other extreme right wings may be salivating at the idea of re-establishing Gush Katif settlements (formerly near Khan Yunis) in the southern Gaza Strip. But none of them were part of the former top Israeli war cabinet, and even currently they do not direct or lead the war. They may try, but this is not official government policy. 

I am trying to explain that is/was not the intention of Israel/IDF to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip. It’s kinda an ancient war maxime (idk what is it called), but you dont destroy the land/ all the buildings if you want to conquer itand considered that land belongs to you.

3. During WW2, Germany didnt destroy Paris. They tried when they were losing and evacuating, but not at the start. They wanted Paris to be intact. And you would too if you are conquering Paris. There is a suggestion (some might dispute it) that the German leader who cannot be named during WW2, did not REALLY wanted to conquer Britain. After defeating France, Germany thought Britain would make peace. There were lots of destruction during the Battle of Britain especially London.

4. US dropped nuclear bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, flatten them. US had no intention of permanently conquering Japan. US never saw Japan as part of US land. US wanted to end the war, and thought using nuclear bomb will do that, and it did, Japan surrendered. US was in Japan for a bit to sort things out then quickly handed over to a transitional Japanese government. US had no intention of conquering Japan.

5. US dropped more than 7.5 million tons of bombs in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. US had no intention of permanently conquering Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos. It’s easier to completely destroy something you dont want/need and even easier if you are not the one going to clean up the mess later down the line. See the pattern….Israel has no intention of funding the rebuilding of Gaza with Israeli money. But that doesnt mean Israel will prevent others from funding the rebuilding of Gaza, mainly from donations from USA, Europe, Arab, Muslim countries and rest of international world but not Israel.

6. I dont have the facts, can someone check how was the six days war fought in Jerusalem ? If my theory is correct, my prediction would be, there should be minimal destruction in Jerusalem. Israel wants/wanted Jerusalem, and to be intact, not flatten. See the difference with Gaza Strip. 

7. What is Jerusalem worth ? Saladdin replied Nothing, then said Everything. I am not saying its historically accurate, i wanted to emphasize how people think. Jerusalem is worth nothing and everything. You wont want to destroy something that valuable. 

8. At the beginning of the Ukraine war, did you noticed the Russia’s attack was very tactical and calculated…lets attack the telecommunication system, military bases, military airbase, railway lines etc… I think at this moment, Putin really thought Ukraine was part of Russia, so he wasnt intending to flatten Ukraine. But Putin’s invasion plans didnt go as plan, F£*&amp; it… then Russia started to change tactic and started to obliterate cities like Bahmut, Mariupol, Kharkiv, etc... Well, if Putin cant have Ukraine, nobody else can…. might as well flatten it. 

9. Even if any US states try to secede from USA, the US military is unlikely going to flatten their cities. Because Washington would have concluded that is part of US land, we shouldnt cause that much destruction. Not to mention the bad press, criticism, protests, etc… the people there are American citizens and they might have family and friends in other parts of the USA. If its not US land, well… I can tell you the approach will be very different.

10. These intentions are not static, and can change. Trump probably has a few ideas of his own and will start making changes next year. Currently, there is rumors that part of Gaza Strip in the north might be turned into a buffer zone by IDF. I think the reason is for security purpose, not for the purpose to annex and not to settle in Gaza. And I dont think it will be permanent either.

Many Palestinians are mentally stuck in the year 1948, never acknowledged the existence of Israel (on any territory), and believe history can be reversed. while in Israel the term is not even used anymore, the goal of Zionism was achieved in 1948. The people who want to build settlements in Gaza and annex the West Bank are not referred to as zionists- they are messianic right-wing settlers. Most ""zionists"" would be glad to see a two-state solution and wouldn't mind giving up settlements in the West Bank in a future deal. Besides we see sometimes the use of the term zionist as a cover-up for the word ""Jew"". American Jew who believes Israel should exist? The average pro-Palestinian can call you a dirty zionist without being blamed for being antisemitic. while in reality, we can't erase the fact that half of the world's Jewish population live in Israel and more than 90% of the world's Jews believe it should exist (and that doesn't mean agreeing to the government's action or supporting what's happening in Gaza and the west bank)",IsraelPalestine,12/3/2024 9:53,1h4mvic,Heavy_Ad5500,0,1,0,True,11/9/2023 2:03,0,0,1,60,61,59,"I grew up for 40 years thinking mass antisemitism was a thing of the past. I’d still like to believe that but much of what has happened in response to this conflict makes that hard. I’m not getting why,if not for antisemitism, are people are so anti-Zionist and why this conflict is so focussed on. I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement? 

And this isn’t the only conflict in the world. It’s not even the largest by people killed or involved. Here is a map that shows all current conflicts. https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker

Why is the focus on Ukraine minimal when it is one if the most despicable wars ever with the potential of the collapse of Western society? 

People deny this is rooted in antisemitism and I want to believe they’re accurate, but in our community, we just can’t come up with any other reason!

To re-start the Peace Process, Netanyahu accepted a 2 state solution in Bar Ilan and later halted settlement construction, which damaged him in his Political Base

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.

I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement? 

And this isn’t the only conflict in the world. It’s not even the largest by people killed or involved. Here is a map that shows all current conflicts. https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker 

Most I hadn’t even heard of, but why no focus on the conflicts and genocide in Sudan where 25 million people need humanitarian aid and 12 million have been displaced? Why is the focus on Ukraine minimal when it is one if the most despicable wars ever with the potential of the collapse of Western society? 

People deny this is rooted in antisemitism and I want to believe they’re accurate, but in our community, we just can’t come up with any other reason! So if you are Anti-Zionist, what do you think Zionism is? Do we not have the right to self define? Is the definition offensive to you? And why is this conflict so important to you if you aren’t Jewish, Israeli, Palestinian, Iranian, Muslim etc? Why not other conflicts?

There's certainly a scriptural basis for the idea of Jews having a *connection* to the land of Israel, but there's nothing I've found in the Jewish tradition/scriture that says Jews need to be in the majority. 

Or maybe something totally different? I know Israel was *planned* as a Jewish state by the UN partition plan, same as Pakistan was planned as a Muslim state.. 

I'm not challenging the idea that it should be majority Jewish. (There's basically no such thing as a state whose native ethnic people has not remained in the majority -- France, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Germany, especially Japan, etc., all remain something like 85%-95% ethnically homogeneous.  So I don't see anything strange about Jews being the majority in Israel.) 

So I'm not asking ""why"" as a way to criticize Israel.  I'm searching for all the possible reasons why any stakeholders want to keep it majority Jewish.

The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

People deny this is rooted in antisemitism and I want to believe they’re accurate, but in our community, we just can’t come up with any other reason! So if you are Anti-Zionist, what do you think Zionism is? Do we not have the right to self define? Is the definition offensive to you?

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces.

1429,m03ee5u,1,"That is false. The first settlers in Palestine trying to pursue the zionist dream arrived around 1880, it was a small group of university students that weren't allowed to get an education under the Russian Empire because they were Jews. They also weren't allowed to own any land (because they were Jews) which motivated them to work their own ancestral land in Palestine - also called Judea before that, but renamed by the Romans when they chased the Jews out. 

Jews hadn't been safe anywhere for a long time and in Eastern Europe they were worse off than in other places. Obviously the N*zis eventually topped that. By the time WW2 ended in 1945, the Zionist project was well underway. The UN didn't just create a state out of nothing. 

&gt;If it wasn't about them not being safe anywhere, then every group in the world should also be entitled to ""self determination"" no? 

Well, every group in the world is indeed entitled to it and that's what nationalism is about. You probably do have your own state to call home where you're not a minority, so I'm not sure how you can claim you're not safe anywhere just like the pre-Israel Jews were. 

&gt;They're not going around killing people for land like the zionists did.

Neither did the zionists. They bought the land, they developed it, they managed to get a state through good diplomacy and occasionally quarreled with the Arabs because that's what the Arabs liked to do. They didn't just arrive in Palestine and claimed the land Conan the Barbarian style.

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.



Anyways, I could go on, but I think my general point has been made…

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.

What they do not realise is that the opposite is true. Not only is defeat possible, but in Gaza, they are winning.

For one, countless anaylsts, including those in Israel have commented that Israel has already lost the war. And that it cannot beat Hamas or the Palestinian Joint-Operations Room.

[As early as last month,](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/israel-losing-netanyahu-wont-back-down-his-war-aims) the British defence think tank reported that:

&gt; Israel is not achieving its war aims against Hamas. First, it has only obtained a handful of the hostages. Some have been killed; the fates of many others are still unknown.

Second, Hamas has not been destroyed. Destruction of a terrorist organisation is difficult to measure. Some point to leadership decapitation. However, as Jenna Jordan has pointed out, attriting terrorist leaders seldom brings about their organisations’ collapse. Factors such as popular support, ideology and organisational structure play bigger roles in deciding these groups’ fates. Another measure used to determine if a terrorist group has been destroyed is if its territorial sphere has been reduced or removed. Israel has failed to deprive Hamas of the territory it governed prior to the war. Hamas has been battered in Gaza, but it is still a political force to be reckoned with. Unaffiliated Palestinian clans have refused to join in a post-war reconstruction effort for fear of retaliation by Hamas. Third, Israel has not been able to secure its borders. While it has regained control over some border crossings, the underground infrastructure that has allowed Hamas to engage in smuggling weapons and carrying out attacks is still in place.

[Analdou Agency reported that a former Mossad chief had stated that Israel was unequovically losing the war in Gaza.](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-on-losing-end-in-gaza-war-former-mossad-deputy-chief/3223179). Even Zionist publishers like [JP reported this](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-803955).

[As CNN has reported, Hamas has remained wholly combat effective.](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/08/middleeast/gaza-israel-hamas-battalions-invs-intl/). This is a pattern that staretd early in the war. By December, the IDF was declaring most Hamas batallions to have been dismantled.

This was quickly revealed to be a propaganda lie. As in early 2024, reports emerged that Hamas had begun rehabilitating its batallions in North Gaza. Reports from the Neo-Conservative think tank isw argued that as much as 80% of Hamas' fighting strength was restored. 

According to the isw's report on MArch 27th, they argue that this means Palestinian fighters ""retain  significant degree of combat effectiveness in the area, despite continued Israeli clearing efforts around Gaza City."" and that ""The return of Israeli forces to [Zaytoun] suggests that Palestinian militias continue to operate there similar to how these militias still have a presence in other portions of the northern Gaza Strip.""

We can also check pretty much every battle in Gaza to see how this is true.

The first battle in Gaza was the battle of Beit Hanoun. Despite IDF claims, they never occupied the city. And the battle is considered as having ended in a Palestinian victory. The isw reported that when the IDF left in December, the P-JOR continued effective control over Beit Hanoun. Beit Hanoun was used as a base to attack the IDF and send rockets into Israel, demonstrating that teh IDF had failed to defeat the JOR in Beit Hanoun.

Then we have the First Battle of Jabalia. As the isw reported, Hamas retained control of Jabalia after Israel withdrew in May. 

&gt; ""These points taken together reflect the degree to which Hamas and other Palestinian militias remain combat effective in and around Jabalia. Hamas and the other militias will almost certainly resume their efforts to reconstitute there as the IDF units have left.""

Then we have the Battle of Shuja'iyya. Though the IDF declared victory here, heavy casualties forced them to withdraw and as al-Jazeera reported, Palestinians retained control of the city. Further evidence of Palestinain control is that several months later, the IDF returned to the region to try and wrestle control away from the JOR.

This 2nd battle was just as disastrous for the IDF. After retreating in July, Hamas and the PIJ retained dominance in the city. Again, al-Jazeera reported how this had occured. But not stopping there, when the IDF withdrew in videos from the area one could see Palestinian militants with guns in their hands standing around in broad daylight. Alongside this, government officials working for the P-JOR immediately remerged in the city, as if they had never left, and reasserted doubly Palestinian control in the region.

Then we have the siege of Khan Yunis. The first Israeli assualt ended in abject failure. so great was the routing of the IDF they withdrew from all of southern Gaza. Khan Yunis itself remained under the control of the Joint Operations Room. Again, as reported by the isw. The 2nd and 3rd battles ended in much the same way and in far shorter timespans.

Then comes al-Qarara. By all acounts, a Palestinian victory.The isw reported that Israel was defeated in al-Qarara. They had failed to achieve any of their aims. P-JOR remained in control. No high ranking militants were found or killed, and accordinng to anaylsts, Hamas remained combat effective in the region.

This is how every battle that has ended thus far has gone. Israel went in, killed civilians for a few weeks. Ran into resistance, tried to fight back, upon seeing heavy casualties retreated with Palestine still in control.

This is not what victory looks like. Israel is, by all measures losing.","The evidence that Hamas is in fact, beating the IDF in Gaza",0.18,0,0,11/30/2024 16:33,1.0,Pro-Israel

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.



Anyways, I could go on, but I think my general point has been made…

Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence, who prevented holocaust survivors from seeking refuge in the British Mandate.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted. Please research the ways Palestinians are treated in Lebanon and Jordan, where they are banned from certain professions, from owning property, from having full citizenship, all so they can be used as a political tool to put pressure on Israel.

Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence, who prevented holocaust survivors from seeking refuge in the British Mandate.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted. Please research the ways Palestinians are treated in Lebanon and Jordan, where they are banned from certain professions, from owning property, from having full citizenship, all so they can be used as a political tool to put pressure on Israel.

It seems fighting is still continuing by Israelis against Hezbollah.   

As far as I know, Israel couldn't negotiate a deal to end hezbollah but instead negotiated a deal to only move hezbollah north of the litani and not allow new weapon supplies, but it did not mention any ideas of disarming hezbollah north of the litani. This was the ceasefire terms agreed upon both sides.   

While it would have been better for Lebanese and for Israelis to have a deal ensuring disarming Hezbollah as a foreign backed militia in Lebanon, this was not the deal Israel was achieved.   

Ever since the ceasefire, Israel has continued attacks on what it claims are hezbollah targets, but they are doing so even north of the Litani river where the deal that both sides agreed to did not mention that hezbollah can't operate there.   

I'm afraid this will do nothing but put anyone who opposes hezbollah from the Lebanese side in a bad position because this would only prove that you can't trust israeli ceasefires and terms. This will only give hezbollah more reasons to remain legitimate and will dismiss any Lebanese efforts to take control.     
   
   
EDIT: From one of the replies:

[link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/israel-hezbollah-syria-ceasefire-gaza-world-central-kitchen/)

&gt; An Israeli airstrike on a car in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed five people, including employees of World Central Kitchen. The charity said it was ""urgently seeking more details"" after Israel's military said it targeted a WCK worker who was part of the Hamas attack that sparked the war.

&gt; Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites along Syria's border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said Saturday, testing a fragile, days-old ceasefire that has seen continued sporadic fire.

&gt; The military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria into Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect, which the military said was a violation of its terms. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities or Hezbollah.

Hezbollah smuggling arms is a clear violation of ceasefire terms

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas.

He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces.

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.



Anyways, I could go on, but I think my general point has been made…

People deny this is rooted in antisemitism and I want to believe they’re accurate, but in our community, we just can’t come up with any other reason! So if you are Anti-Zionist, what do you think Zionism is? Do we not have the right to self define? Is the definition offensive to you? And why is this conflict so important to you if you aren’t Jewish, Israeli, Palestinian, Iranian, Muslim etc? Why not other conflicts?

Hi everyone! I host a podcast called *Israel &amp; Palestine Unpacked* ([listen here](https://open.spotify.com/show/2o0vVS6BuKrZ21NYxiGsgB)). I’m reaching out to Israelis and Palestinians who are willing to share their personal stories for an upcoming series of episodes. 

The purpose of the podcast is to foster meaningful dialogue and shed light on the human experiences that define life in Israel and Palestine. Through a series of personal stories, we aim to showcase the realities faced by individuals as they navigate their daily lives in this complex region. Each 30-minute episode offers an in-depth exploration of these narratives, featuring interviews with both an Israeli and a Palestinian. Together, they share their perspectives on profound topics such as identity, resilience, and hope, revealing the shared humanity that connects us all.

We’d love to hear your perspective, especially if you’ve experienced the following, but not limited to:

* **Crossing borders and checkpoints**: How does this shape your daily life?
* **Parenting during conflict**: How do you raise children in such challenging environments?
* **Living in mixed or segregated communities**: What are the realities of these spaces?
* **Friendships across divides**: How do you build and maintain connections?
* **Sports**: Can it unite people, or does it create more division?
* **Experiences of conflict**: How has this impacted your perspective?
* **Dreams and aspirations**: What do you hope for your future and your community?
* **Media and misinformation**: How does it shape perceptions and realities in the region?

I know these topics can be deeply personal and emotional, but your story matters. Sharing your perspective can challenge stereotypes, bridge divides, and foster greater empathy among listeners around the world.

If you’re interested or know someone who might be, please send me a private message. Every voice has value, and together, we can create something impactful.

What they do not realise is that the opposite is true. Not only is defeat possible, but in Gaza, they are winning.

For one, countless anaylsts, including those in Israel have commented that Israel has already lost the war. And that it cannot beat Hamas or the Palestinian Joint-Operations Room.

[As early as last month,](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/israel-losing-netanyahu-wont-back-down-his-war-aims) the British defence think tank reported that:

&gt; Israel is not achieving its war aims against Hamas. First, it has only obtained a handful of the hostages. Some have been killed; the fates of many others are still unknown.

Second, Hamas has not been destroyed. Destruction of a terrorist organisation is difficult to measure. Some point to leadership decapitation. However, as Jenna Jordan has pointed out, attriting terrorist leaders seldom brings about their organisations’ collapse. Factors such as popular support, ideology and organisational structure play bigger roles in deciding these groups’ fates. Another measure used to determine if a terrorist group has been destroyed is if its territorial sphere has been reduced or removed. Israel has failed to deprive Hamas of the territory it governed prior to the war. Hamas has been battered in Gaza, but it is still a political force to be reckoned with. Unaffiliated Palestinian clans have refused to join in a post-war reconstruction effort for fear of retaliation by Hamas. Third, Israel has not been able to secure its borders. While it has regained control over some border crossings, the underground infrastructure that has allowed Hamas to engage in smuggling weapons and carrying out attacks is still in place.

[Analdou Agency reported that a former Mossad chief had stated that Israel was unequovically losing the war in Gaza.](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-on-losing-end-in-gaza-war-former-mossad-deputy-chief/3223179). Even Zionist publishers like [JP reported this](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-803955).

[As CNN has reported, Hamas has remained wholly combat effective.](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/08/middleeast/gaza-israel-hamas-battalions-invs-intl/). This is a pattern that staretd early in the war. By December, the IDF was declaring most Hamas batallions to have been dismantled.

This was quickly revealed to be a propaganda lie. As in early 2024, reports emerged that Hamas had begun rehabilitating its batallions in North Gaza. Reports from the Neo-Conservative think tank isw argued that as much as 80% of Hamas' fighting strength was restored. 

According to the isw's report on MArch 27th, they argue that this means Palestinian fighters ""retain  significant degree of combat effectiveness in the area, despite continued Israeli clearing efforts around Gaza City."" and that ""The return of Israeli forces to [Zaytoun] suggests that Palestinian militias continue to operate there similar to how these militias still have a presence in other portions of the northern Gaza Strip.""

We can also check pretty much every battle in Gaza to see how this is true.

The first battle in Gaza was the battle of Beit Hanoun. Despite IDF claims, they never occupied the city. And the battle is considered as having ended in a Palestinian victory. The isw reported that when the IDF left in December, the P-JOR continued effective control over Beit Hanoun. Beit Hanoun was used as a base to attack the IDF and send rockets into Israel, demonstrating that teh IDF had failed to defeat the JOR in Beit Hanoun.

Then we have the First Battle of Jabalia. As the isw reported, Hamas retained control of Jabalia after Israel withdrew in May. 

&gt; ""These points taken together reflect the degree to which Hamas and other Palestinian militias remain combat effective in and around Jabalia. Hamas and the other militias will almost certainly resume their efforts to reconstitute there as the IDF units have left.""

Then we have the Battle of Shuja'iyya. Though the IDF declared victory here, heavy casualties forced them to withdraw and as al-Jazeera reported, Palestinians retained control of the city. Further evidence of Palestinain control is that several months later, the IDF returned to the region to try and wrestle control away from the JOR.

This 2nd battle was just as disastrous for the IDF. After retreating in July, Hamas and the PIJ retained dominance in the city. Again, al-Jazeera reported how this had occured. But not stopping there, when the IDF withdrew in videos from the area one could see Palestinian militants with guns in their hands standing around in broad daylight. Alongside this, government officials working for the P-JOR immediately remerged in the city, as if they had never left, and reasserted doubly Palestinian control in the region.

Then we have the siege of Khan Yunis. The first Israeli assualt ended in abject failure. so great was the routing of the IDF they withdrew from all of southern Gaza. Khan Yunis itself remained under the control of the Joint Operations Room. Again, as reported by the isw. The 2nd and 3rd battles ended in much the same way and in far shorter timespans.

Then comes al-Qarara. By all acounts, a Palestinian victory.The isw reported that Israel was defeated in al-Qarara. They had failed to achieve any of their aims. P-JOR remained in control. No high ranking militants were found or killed, and accordinng to anaylsts, Hamas remained combat effective in the region.

This is how every battle that has ended thus far has gone. Israel went in, killed civilians for a few weeks. Ran into resistance, tried to fight back, upon seeing heavy casualties retreated with Palestine still in control.

This is not what victory looks like. Israel is, by all measures losing.","The evidence that Hamas is in fact, beating the IDF in Gaza",0.18,0,0,11/30/2024 16:33,1.0,Pro-Israel

https://x.com/MTVEnglishNews/status/1863159187968045521   

It seems fighting is still continuing by Israelis against Hezbollah.   

As far as I know, Israel couldn't negotiate a deal to end hezbollah but instead negotiated a deal to only move hezbollah north of the litani and not allow new weapon supplies, but it did not mention any ideas of disarming hezbollah north of the litani. This was the ceasefire terms agreed upon both sides.   

While it would have been better for Lebanese and for Israelis to have a deal ensuring disarming Hezbollah as a foreign backed militia in Lebanon, this was not the deal Israel was achieved.   

Ever since the ceasefire, Israel has continued attacks on what it claims are hezbollah targets, but they are doing so even north of the Litani river where the deal that both sides agreed to did not mention that hezbollah can't operate there.   

I'm afraid this will do nothing but put anyone who opposes hezbollah from the Lebanese side in a bad position because this would only prove that you can't trust israeli ceasefires and terms. This will only give hezbollah more reasons to remain legitimate and will dismiss any Lebanese efforts to take control.     
   
   
EDIT: From one of the replies:

[link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/israel-hezbollah-syria-ceasefire-gaza-world-central-kitchen/)

&gt; An Israeli airstrike on a car in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed five people, including employees of World Central Kitchen. The charity said it was ""urgently seeking more details"" after Israel's military said it targeted a WCK worker who was part of the Hamas attack that sparked the war.

&gt; Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites along Syria's border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said Saturday, testing a fragile, days-old ceasefire that has seen continued sporadic fire.

&gt; The military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria into Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect, which the military said was a violation of its terms. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities or Hezbollah.

Hezbollah smuggling arms is a clear violation of ceasefire terms

---

However, that does not explain why Israel has bombed a member of the Lebanese Army in the far north. They're also destroying random buildings in the south, that was not part of any agreement.

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

1063,m045j12,1,"Nope, they attacked Jews before Israel was even declared a state. And the great majority of violence since then has been Israel defending itself from being wiped out.

You can be antisemitic if that's your choice. But don't pretend it's some logical reaction.",IsraelPalestine,12/2/2024 23:19,1h4mvic,Special-Ad-2785,0,1,0,True,9/21/2020 18:46,0,0,61,432,493,59,"I grew up for 40 years thinking mass antisemitism was a thing of the past. I’d still like to believe that but much of what has happened in response to this conflict makes that hard. I’m not getting why,if not for antisemitism, are people are so anti-Zionist and why this conflict is so focussed on. I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement? 

And this isn’t the only conflict in the world. It’s not even the largest by people killed or involved. Here is a map that shows all current conflicts. https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker 

Most I hadn’t even heard of, but why no focus on the conflicts and genocide in Sudan where 25 million people need humanitarian aid and 12 million have been displaced? Why is the focus on Ukraine minimal when it is one if the most despicable wars ever with the potential of the collapse of Western society? 

People deny this is rooted in antisemitism and I want to believe they’re accurate, but in our community, we just can’t come up with any other reason! So if you are Anti-Zionist, what do you think Zionism is? Do we not have the right to self define? Is the definition offensive to you? And why is this conflict so important to you if you aren’t Jewish, Israeli, Palestinian, Iranian, Muslim etc? Why not other conflicts?
