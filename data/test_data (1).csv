https://x.com/MTVEnglishNews/status/1863159187968045521   

It seems fighting is still continuing by Israelis against Hezbollah.   

As far as I know, Israel couldn't negotiate a deal to end hezbollah but instead negotiated a deal to only move hezbollah north of the litani and not allow new weapon supplies, but it did not mention any ideas of disarming hezbollah north of the litani. This was the ceasefire terms agreed upon both sides.   

While it would have been better for Lebanese and for Israelis to have a deal ensuring disarming Hezbollah as a foreign backed militia in Lebanon, this was not the deal Israel was achieved.   

Ever since the ceasefire, Israel has continued attacks on what it claims are hezbollah targets, but they are doing so even north of the Litani river where the deal that both sides agreed to did not mention that hezbollah can't operate there.   

I'm afraid this will do nothing but put anyone who opposes hezbollah from the Lebanese side in a bad position because this would only prove that you can't trust israeli ceasefires and terms. This will only give hezbollah more reasons to remain legitimate and will dismiss any Lebanese efforts to take control.     
   
   
EDIT: From one of the replies:

[link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/israel-hezbollah-syria-ceasefire-gaza-world-central-kitchen/)

&gt; An Israeli airstrike on a car in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed five people, including employees of World Central Kitchen. The charity said it was ""urgently seeking more details"" after Israel's military said it targeted a WCK worker who was part of the Hamas attack that sparked the war.

&gt; Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites along Syria's border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said Saturday, testing a fragile, days-old ceasefire that has seen continued sporadic fire.

&gt; The military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria into Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect, which the military said was a violation of its terms. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities or Hezbollah.

Hezbollah smuggling arms is a clear violation of ceasefire terms

However, that does not explain why Israel has bombed a member of the Lebanese Army in the far north. They're also destroying random buildings in the south, that was not part of any agreement.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

I’d still like to believe that but much of what has happened in response to this conflict makes that hard. I’m not getting why,if not for antisemitism, are people are so anti-Zionist and why this conflict is so focussed on. I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

Yet, despite this significant offer, none of the 101 hostages have been successfully returned so far. What makes this even more perplexing is the clear evidence that some of the hostages are being sheltered and cared for by Gazan civilians. This raises an unsettling question: how could a father, who has the chance to secure safety, a better future for his family, and an improved quality of life, choose instead to keep a hostage? 

This decision defies logic on multiple levels. It is not just about the economic or material benefits offered by Israel. The offer promises a lifeline, an escape from the hardships and dangers that many Gazan civilians face daily. Accepting such an offer would theoretically guarantee safety from ongoing conflicts, access to better healthcare and education, and a future of stability. Yet, the fact that no one has taken advantage of this opportunity suggests a deeper, more troubling dynamic at play.

It leads me to consider whether hatred toward Israelis surpasses the love for their own children among some Gazans. Is the hostility so deeply ingrained that it eclipses even the instinctual drive to protect and provide for their families? This possibility is deeply unsettling, as it speaks to a cycle of animosity that overrides self-preservation and the pursuit of a better life.

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

Yet, despite this significant offer, none of the 101 hostages have been successfully returned so far. What makes this even more perplexing is the clear evidence that some of the hostages are being sheltered and cared for by Gazan civilians. This raises an unsettling question: how could a father, who has the chance to secure safety, a better future for his family, and an improved quality of life, choose instead to keep a hostage? 

This decision defies logic on multiple levels. It is not just about the economic or material benefits offered by Israel. The offer promises a lifeline, an escape from the hardships and dangers that many Gazan civilians face daily. Accepting such an offer would theoretically guarantee safety from ongoing conflicts, access to better healthcare and education, and a future of stability. Yet, the fact that no one has taken advantage of this opportunity suggests a deeper, more troubling dynamic at play.

It leads me to consider whether hatred toward Israelis surpasses the love for their own children among some Gazans. Is the hostility so deeply ingrained that it eclipses even the instinctual drive to protect and provide for their families? This possibility is deeply unsettling, as it speaks to a cycle of animosity that overrides self-preservation and the pursuit of a better life.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

“Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

is simplistic. in its purest form yes but what disagreed about is what should consist of that homeland.  
The main complain by anti-zionists is that some off shots of zionism do see jewish people as superior and call for expanding the lands of isreal to ""greater isreal"" whilst this is not main stream opinion in Isreal.  
it is a doctrine that the Lukid party itself subscribes to.

&gt;The Likud party, founded in 1973, has historically supported the concept of a ""Greater Israel,"" advocating for Israeli sovereignty over territories such as the West Bank and Gaza Strip. This stance was evident in its original platform, which promoted Jewish settlement in these areas

[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/original-party-platform-of-the-likud-party](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/original-party-platform-of-the-likud-party)

&gt;the party's official platform still emphasizes the importance of maintaining Israeli control over significant portions of the West Bank, reflecting its foundational ideology. This dual approach highlights Likud's complex position, balancing its traditional Greater Israel aspirations with pragmatic considerations in the face of ongoing regional dynamics and international pressures.

For example I support iThe movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in the land of Isreal."" I dont subscribe to the fact it should be their ""Ancestral homeland as that is rife with conflict that entails due to completing claims and international law etc.

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

What they do not realise is that the opposite is true. Not only is defeat possible, but in Gaza, they are winning.

For one, countless anaylsts, including those in Israel have commented that Israel has already lost the war. And that it cannot beat Hamas or the Palestinian Joint-Operations Room.

[As early as last month,](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/israel-losing-netanyahu-wont-back-down-his-war-aims) the British defence think tank reported that:

&gt; Israel is not achieving its war aims against Hamas. First, it has only obtained a handful of the hostages. Some have been killed; the fates of many others are still unknown.

Second, Hamas has not been destroyed. Destruction of a terrorist organisation is difficult to measure. Some point to leadership decapitation. However, as Jenna Jordan has pointed out, attriting terrorist leaders seldom brings about their organisations’ collapse. Factors such as popular support, ideology and organisational structure play bigger roles in deciding these groups’ fates. Another measure used to determine if a terrorist group has been destroyed is if its territorial sphere has been reduced or removed. Israel has failed to deprive Hamas of the territory it governed prior to the war. Hamas has been battered in Gaza, but it is still a political force to be reckoned with. Unaffiliated Palestinian clans have refused to join in a post-war reconstruction effort for fear of retaliation by Hamas. Third, Israel has not been able to secure its borders. While it has regained control over some border crossings, the underground infrastructure that has allowed Hamas to engage in smuggling weapons and carrying out attacks is still in place.

[Analdou Agency reported that a former Mossad chief had stated that Israel was unequovically losing the war in Gaza.](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-on-losing-end-in-gaza-war-former-mossad-deputy-chief/3223179). Even Zionist publishers like [JP reported this](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-803955).

[As CNN has reported, Hamas has remained wholly combat effective.](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/08/middleeast/gaza-israel-hamas-battalions-invs-intl/). This is a pattern that staretd early in the war. By December, the IDF was declaring most Hamas batallions to have been dismantled.

This was quickly revealed to be a propaganda lie. As in early 2024, reports emerged that Hamas had begun rehabilitating its batallions in North Gaza. Reports from the Neo-Conservative think tank isw argued that as much as 80% of Hamas' fighting strength was restored. 

According to the isw's report on MArch 27th, they argue that this means Palestinian fighters ""retain  significant degree of combat effectiveness in the area, despite continued Israeli clearing efforts around Gaza City."" and that ""The return of Israeli forces to [Zaytoun] suggests that Palestinian militias continue to operate there similar to how these militias still have a presence in other portions of the northern Gaza Strip.""

We can also check pretty much every battle in Gaza to see how this is true.

The first battle in Gaza was the battle of Beit Hanoun. Despite IDF claims, they never occupied the city. And the battle is considered as having ended in a Palestinian victory. The isw reported that when the IDF left in December, the P-JOR continued effective control over Beit Hanoun. Beit Hanoun was used as a base to attack the IDF and send rockets into Israel, demonstrating that teh IDF had failed to defeat the JOR in Beit Hanoun.

Then we have the First Battle of Jabalia. As the isw reported, Hamas retained control of Jabalia after Israel withdrew in May. 

&gt; ""These points taken together reflect the degree to which Hamas and other Palestinian militias remain combat effective in and around Jabalia. Hamas and the other militias will almost certainly resume their efforts to reconstitute there as the IDF units have left.""

Then we have the Battle of Shuja'iyya. Though the IDF declared victory here, heavy casualties forced them to withdraw and as al-Jazeera reported, Palestinians retained control of the city. Further evidence of Palestinain control is that several months later, the IDF returned to the region to try and wrestle control away from the JOR.

This 2nd battle was just as disastrous for the IDF. After retreating in July, Hamas and the PIJ retained dominance in the city. Again, al-Jazeera reported how this had occured. But not stopping there, when the IDF withdrew in videos from the area one could see Palestinian militants with guns in their hands standing around in broad daylight. Alongside this, government officials working for the P-JOR immediately remerged in the city, as if they had never left, and reasserted doubly Palestinian control in the region.

Then we have the siege of Khan Yunis. The first Israeli assualt ended in abject failure. so great was the routing of the IDF they withdrew from all of southern Gaza. Khan Yunis itself remained under the control of the Joint Operations Room. Again, as reported by the isw. The 2nd and 3rd battles ended in much the same way and in far shorter timespans.

Then comes al-Qarara. By all acounts, a Palestinian victory.The isw reported that Israel was defeated in al-Qarara. They had failed to achieve any of their aims. P-JOR remained in control. No high ranking militants were found or killed, and accordinng to anaylsts, Hamas remained combat effective in the region.

This is how every battle that has ended thus far has gone. Israel went in, killed civilians for a few weeks. Ran into resistance, tried to fight back, upon seeing heavy casualties retreated with Palestine still in control.

This is not what victory looks like. Israel is, by all measures losing.","The evidence that Hamas is in fact, beating the IDF in Gaza",0.18,0,0,11/30/2024 16:33,1.0,Pro-Israel

Global news is now local news.

I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally .

With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not.

There's certainly a scriptural basis for the idea of Jews having a *connection* to the land of Israel, but there's nothing I've found in the Jewish tradition/scriture that says Jews need to be in the majority.

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.



Anyways, I could go on, but I think my general point has been made…",The Palestinian cause has already won in the court of public opinion,0.52,13,0,12/1/2024 22:32,-1.0,Pro-Palestine

Hi everyone! I host a podcast called *Israel &amp; Palestine Unpacked* ([listen here](https://open.spotify.com/show/2o0vVS6BuKrZ21NYxiGsgB)). I’m reaching out to Israelis and Palestinians who are willing to share their personal stories for an upcoming series of episodes. 

The purpose of the podcast is to foster meaningful dialogue and shed light on the human experiences that define life in Israel and Palestine. Through a series of personal stories, we aim to showcase the realities faced by individuals as they navigate their daily lives in this complex region. Each 30-minute episode offers an in-depth exploration of these narratives, featuring interviews with both an Israeli and a Palestinian. Together, they share their perspectives on profound topics such as identity, resilience, and hope, revealing the shared humanity that connects us all.

We’d love to hear your perspective, especially if you’ve experienced the following, but not limited to:

* **Crossing borders and checkpoints**: How does this shape your daily life?
* **Parenting during conflict**: How do you raise children in such challenging environments?
* **Living in mixed or segregated communities**: What are the realities of these spaces?
* **Friendships across divides**: How do you build and maintain connections?
* **Sports**: Can it unite people, or does it create more division?
* **Experiences of conflict**: How has this impacted your perspective?
* **Dreams and aspirations**: What do you hope for your future and your community?
* **Media and misinformation**: How does it shape perceptions and realities in the region?

I know these topics can be deeply personal and emotional, but your story matters. Sharing your perspective can challenge stereotypes, bridge divides, and foster greater empathy among listeners around the world.

If you’re interested or know someone who might be, please send me a private message. Every voice has value, and together, we can create something impactful.

What they do not realise is that the opposite is true. Not only is defeat possible, but in Gaza, they are winning.

For one, countless anaylsts, including those in Israel have commented that Israel has already lost the war. And that it cannot beat Hamas or the Palestinian Joint-Operations Room.

[As early as last month,](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/israel-losing-netanyahu-wont-back-down-his-war-aims) the British defence think tank reported that:

&gt; Israel is not achieving its war aims against Hamas. First, it has only obtained a handful of the hostages. Some have been killed; the fates of many others are still unknown.

Second, Hamas has not been destroyed. Destruction of a terrorist organisation is difficult to measure. Some point to leadership decapitation. However, as Jenna Jordan has pointed out, attriting terrorist leaders seldom brings about their organisations’ collapse. Factors such as popular support, ideology and organisational structure play bigger roles in deciding these groups’ fates. Another measure used to determine if a terrorist group has been destroyed is if its territorial sphere has been reduced or removed. Israel has failed to deprive Hamas of the territory it governed prior to the war. Hamas has been battered in Gaza, but it is still a political force to be reckoned with. Unaffiliated Palestinian clans have refused to join in a post-war reconstruction effort for fear of retaliation by Hamas. Third, Israel has not been able to secure its borders. While it has regained control over some border crossings, the underground infrastructure that has allowed Hamas to engage in smuggling weapons and carrying out attacks is still in place.

[Analdou Agency reported that a former Mossad chief had stated that Israel was unequovically losing the war in Gaza.](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-on-losing-end-in-gaza-war-former-mossad-deputy-chief/3223179). Even Zionist publishers like [JP reported this](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-803955).

[As CNN has reported, Hamas has remained wholly combat effective.](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/08/middleeast/gaza-israel-hamas-battalions-invs-intl/). This is a pattern that staretd early in the war. By December, the IDF was declaring most Hamas batallions to have been dismantled.

This was quickly revealed to be a propaganda lie. As in early 2024, reports emerged that Hamas had begun rehabilitating its batallions in North Gaza. Reports from the Neo-Conservative think tank isw argued that as much as 80% of Hamas' fighting strength was restored. 

According to the isw's report on MArch 27th, they argue that this means Palestinian fighters ""retain  significant degree of combat effectiveness in the area, despite continued Israeli clearing efforts around Gaza City."" and that ""The return of Israeli forces to [Zaytoun] suggests that Palestinian militias continue to operate there similar to how these militias still have a presence in other portions of the northern Gaza Strip.""

We can also check pretty much every battle in Gaza to see how this is true.

The first battle in Gaza was the battle of Beit Hanoun. Despite IDF claims, they never occupied the city. And the battle is considered as having ended in a Palestinian victory. The isw reported that when the IDF left in December, the P-JOR continued effective control over Beit Hanoun. Beit Hanoun was used as a base to attack the IDF and send rockets into Israel, demonstrating that teh IDF had failed to defeat the JOR in Beit Hanoun.

Then we have the First Battle of Jabalia. As the isw reported, Hamas retained control of Jabalia after Israel withdrew in May. 

&gt; ""These points taken together reflect the degree to which Hamas and other Palestinian militias remain combat effective in and around Jabalia. Hamas and the other militias will almost certainly resume their efforts to reconstitute there as the IDF units have left.""

Then we have the Battle of Shuja'iyya. Though the IDF declared victory here, heavy casualties forced them to withdraw and as al-Jazeera reported, Palestinians retained control of the city. Further evidence of Palestinain control is that several months later, the IDF returned to the region to try and wrestle control away from the JOR.

This 2nd battle was just as disastrous for the IDF. After retreating in July, Hamas and the PIJ retained dominance in the city. Again, al-Jazeera reported how this had occured. But not stopping there, when the IDF withdrew in videos from the area one could see Palestinian militants with guns in their hands standing around in broad daylight. Alongside this, government officials working for the P-JOR immediately remerged in the city, as if they had never left, and reasserted doubly Palestinian control in the region.

Then we have the siege of Khan Yunis. The first Israeli assualt ended in abject failure. so great was the routing of the IDF they withdrew from all of southern Gaza. Khan Yunis itself remained under the control of the Joint Operations Room. Again, as reported by the isw. The 2nd and 3rd battles ended in much the same way and in far shorter timespans.

Then comes al-Qarara. By all acounts, a Palestinian victory.The isw reported that Israel was defeated in al-Qarara. They had failed to achieve any of their aims. P-JOR remained in control. No high ranking militants were found or killed, and accordinng to anaylsts, Hamas remained combat effective in the region.

This is how every battle that has ended thus far has gone. Israel went in, killed civilians for a few weeks. Ran into resistance, tried to fight back, upon seeing heavy casualties retreated with Palestine still in control.

This is not what victory looks like. Israel is, by all measures losing.","The evidence that Hamas is in fact, beating the IDF in Gaza",0.18,0,0,11/30/2024 16:33,1.0,Pro-Israel

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.",It's Barack Obama's fault that the Peace Process collapsed. ,0.41,0,0,12/2/2024 8:35,0.0,Neutral

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally.

2808,m00p43l,15,"&gt;Why didn't Germany just give some of its land to them after the holocaust? Wouldn't that have been the fairest thing to do? But no...

What? The fairest thing to do was for them to get the land they'd been developing and settling on for 50 years and that they had historical and spiritual ties to. And that the Palestinians didn't own or really identified with either since their national identity wasn't created until the Jews came around. 

&gt;To then add insult to injury, this new group now starts to expand upon their ""agreed"" boarders every year by nutty settlers who comes and steals your home and has military backing them in he process to make sure there's nothing u can do about it.

Hi everyone! I host a podcast called *Israel &amp; Palestine Unpacked* ([listen here](https://open.spotify.com/show/2o0vVS6BuKrZ21NYxiGsgB)). I’m reaching out to Israelis and Palestinians who are willing to share their personal stories for an upcoming series of episodes. 

The purpose of the podcast is to foster meaningful dialogue and shed light on the human experiences that define life in Israel and Palestine. Through a series of personal stories, we aim to showcase the realities faced by individuals as they navigate their daily lives in this complex region. Each 30-minute episode offers an in-depth exploration of these narratives, featuring interviews with both an Israeli and a Palestinian. Together, they share their perspectives on profound topics such as identity, resilience, and hope, revealing the shared humanity that connects us all.

We’d love to hear your perspective, especially if you’ve experienced the following, but not limited to:

* **Crossing borders and checkpoints**: How does this shape your daily life?
* **Parenting during conflict**: How do you raise children in such challenging environments?
* **Living in mixed or segregated communities**: What are the realities of these spaces?
* **Friendships across divides**: How do you build and maintain connections?
* **Sports**: Can it unite people, or does it create more division?
* **Experiences of conflict**: How has this impacted your perspective?
* **Dreams and aspirations**: What do you hope for your future and your community?
* **Media and misinformation**: How does it shape perceptions and realities in the region?

I know these topics can be deeply personal and emotional, but your story matters. Sharing your perspective can challenge stereotypes, bridge divides, and foster greater empathy among listeners around the world.

If you’re interested or know someone who might be, please send me a private message. Every voice has value, and together, we can create something impactful.

Israelis often feel they're unfairly targeted for their nationality and that you if you're Israeli or shows any Israeli culture literally anywhere, you'll receive harsh criticism, if not outright hatred.



This is absolutely the case. You simply can't even mention Israel at all, or talk about the cutlure of Tel Aviv or Haifa today, without people directly saying that it's all Palestinian land, you're all settlers, etc. It's simply impossible to just share you like Hebrew music or modern Israeli couscous without people bringing up the conflict.


This is especially the case if you're in any context with many people from Middle Eastern, Arab or Muslim people. They aren't known to tolerate people saying they're Israeli.


The same is also true for left-wing activist groups in the West.



It feels really unfair because most other nationalities and ethnicities can simply talk about where they're from without getting an automatic harsh reaction, but they can't. Their very existance is political.



While it's often definitely very related to antisemitism, it's also often motivated by something else, namely, geopolitics and ethnic conflicts.



The thing is, the legitimacy of the State of Israel is not uninamous. Some believe it's not a legitimate state, and it's all an illegal occupation of the sovereign country of Palestine.


You might personally believe it's outrageous and unacceptable, but it's most likely because you grew up in a context where Israel being a state isn't questioned.


But in the Arab World for example most people don't believe Israel is a legitimate state.


But the thing is, the same treatment is often given to people from other disputed or unrecognised regions or states.



For example Abkhazia, it's a partially recognised state in the Caucasus claimed by Georgia as its autonomous region. It declared secession after an ethnic conflict in the 1990s and most of the world doesn't recognise it, except for Russia.


The thing is that the same applies to Abkhazians and any, even apolitical posts about Abkhazia.



If you want to share anything happening in modern day Abkhazia, for example about some caves found there, or about their recent protests there, or their food and culture, people would inevitably bring up Georgia.





And in fact, the vast majority of people will be on the opposing side, and they won't have many people defending them and if not being on their side, at least trying to bring up nuance.


[Ironically, this happens even for people who are themselves citizens of an unrecognised state.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kosovo/comments/1eoar1h/i_want_to_relocate_from_abkhazia_to_kosovo_how_is/)


The problem isn't just that Georgians outnumber Abkhazians (like the Arab World outnumbers Israel) but rather that people that are not directly tied to the conflict will automatically take a side because this will be seen as a proxy for their politics in general. For Abkhazia, the major Western powers (for example the EU) massively support Georgia, and people in the West are against Abkhazia because they believe backing Georgia means being against Russian imperialism.


I've seen it myself, any people who try to bring any nuance to this conflict, even if they're Abkhazian themselves, are accused of being pro Russian. Same with Israel too, in some cases.


Meanwhile, for Israel, left-wing activist circles believe that Israel is a settler colonial state, therefore backing Palestinians at all times is backing decolonization.



Both of these conflicts are actually much more complex than this simplistic narrative, but people don't actually try to learn that, they take sides automatically based on some narrative they've heard.


But because of this politization, merely saying you live in Israel or Abkhazia or are Abkhazian, as opposed to Georgian for example, is seen as itself a political statement.


If you live in Sukhumi and you say you're Abkhazian, even though it's the norm in your society, and saying you're Georgian is as unacceptable as a Georgian saying they're Russian, you're told that if you want to participate in the modern world, you should say you're Georgian and live in Georgia. The same is true for Israelis. If you live in Jaffa, how can you say it's an Israeli city? And use this symbol 🇮🇱 which is very political? For the Palestinians whose family is from there, it can be offensive.


And yes, you can be seen as a settler because the state you live in is seen as illegitimate.


This is very problematic.




All that often also happens with people from other disputed regions or states (Kosovo, South Ossetia, Northern Cyprus, Crimea, Kashmir, Tibet, etc).



Personally, I feel like in both cases, this approach doesn't necessarily help people to actually resolve ethnic conflicts. Instead of actually trying to build ties and create a solution that'll satisfy everyone, for example by strengthening the opposition. For example pro Palestinian people could've supported the Israeli opposition and the Israeli diaspora itself could've been supportive of a Palestinian state and even a right of return. But no, instead, we obsess over the legality of borders and the legitimacy of states, which means people on the opposite side see us as an existential threat to their existance.









We say we're modern people but in reality we're still tribal creatures, unfortunately.


Geopolitics, governments, state sovereignity and independence is unfortunately very ingrained in all of us and it's arguably like modern day religion.



It's sad to fight against this because this doesn't become merely discrimination, but also a geopolitical opinion opposing this state, and it's very hard to draw the lines over what's acceptable and what's not. But often times, people who say that racism is unacceptable still say unacceptable things merely because of the nationality of the person.



**However, unfortunately, this is something that's very common right now and is seen as the natural thing to do. So I've created this post to try to explain the logic of those that oppose anyone automatically if they say they're ""Israelis"", to understand their motivations, to know how to possibly fight against them, and also to oppose similar situations in the Western World, where entire identities become politicised.**



In my opinion, we should really deconstruct the idea of states and nations if we actually want to achieve world peace, or at least strive towards it.


I think we should be much more mindful about how national identities shape our worldview and how people from ""disputed regions"" might still be first and foremost people and we should try to look beyond merely borders and nations, be it recognised or not.




I also believe we shouldn't see the world merely through a lense of ""states"" and ""nations"". I believe the videos and maps about ""X fun thing in every country in the world"" (for example food, music, architecture, fun facts, etc) should also include people without states or with disputed states and that it shouldn't be seen as inherently political. So yeah, including Israel, Palestine, Abkhazia, Tibet, Hawaii, Ingushetia, Tamil Nadu, Jewish diaspora etc. If our world wasn't so fixated on ""countries"", aka, sovereign states, these things would've been much less problematic.

Simply false.  Mostly the Obama administration didn't engage but it unquestionably saw the PA as unreliable and not seriously engaging.

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things.

The first settlers in Palestine trying to pursue the zionist dream arrived around 1880, it was a small group of university students that weren't allowed to get an education under the Russian Empire because they were Jews. They also weren't allowed to own any land (because they were Jews) which motivated them to work their own ancestral land in Palestine - also called Judea before that, but renamed by the Romans when they chased the Jews out. 

Jews hadn't been safe anywhere for a long time and in Eastern Europe they were worse off than in other places. Obviously the N*zis eventually topped that. By the time WW2 ended in 1945, the Zionist project was well underway. The UN didn't just create a state out of nothing.

5537,lzu0ua9,1,"&gt;Because Israel is simply trying to use us to ethnically cleanse Palestinians *again* after doing so every couple of decades.

Israel is trying to win a war against a terrorist organization that uses human shield as its main strategy. If Egypt, Jordan and other Arab majority countries cared about the welfare and safety of Palestinians lives taking them in should be paramount. Leaving them out to dry and die in the crossfire with a government that couldn't care less about their safety doesn't seem so altruistic.

&gt;Hamas celebrates their martyrdom and Israel is trying super hard to not kill anyone? All the evidence would prove otherwise.

The civilian casualty ratio is between 1:1 and 2:1 which is one of the lowest in the history of modern urban warfare. The U.N. has stated the average for conflicts such as this one is around 9:1. So yes, Israel is going to great pains to not kill innocent Palestinians. What makes this especially difficult is enemy tactics and the density of Gaza.

Again, why not condemn Hamas for not protecting its own people in the vast tunnel network it built off of stolen aid that could've been used to build Gaza into a thriving city?

&gt;The Israeli government, which is the longest serving government, and has been in power for most of the time since 1948 doesn't even believe in a Palestinian state or the Palestinian people.

So, why then did it engage in multiple negotiations the Palestinians since its establishment with land swaps and other concessions?

Yet, despite this significant offer, none of the 101 hostages have been successfully returned so far. What makes this even more perplexing is the clear evidence that some of the hostages are being sheltered and cared for by Gazan civilians. This raises an unsettling question: how could a father, who has the chance to secure safety, a better future for his family, and an improved quality of life, choose instead to keep a hostage? 

This decision defies logic on multiple levels. It is not just about the economic or material benefits offered by Israel. The offer promises a lifeline, an escape from the hardships and dangers that many Gazan civilians face daily. Accepting such an offer would theoretically guarantee safety from ongoing conflicts, access to better healthcare and education, and a future of stability. Yet, the fact that no one has taken advantage of this opportunity suggests a deeper, more troubling dynamic at play.

It leads me to consider whether hatred toward Israelis surpasses the love for their own children among some Gazans. Is the hostility so deeply ingrained that it eclipses even the instinctual drive to protect and provide for their families? This possibility is deeply unsettling, as it speaks to a cycle of animosity that overrides self-preservation and the pursuit of a better life.

I know the general idea was to create a place where Jews would be safe, and I suppose that's the main reason to keep a Jewish majority.

There's certainly a scriptural basis for the idea of Jews having a *connection* to the land of Israel, but there's nothing I've found in the Jewish tradition/scriture that says Jews need to be in the majority.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

https://x.com/MTVEnglishNews/status/1863159187968045521   

It seems fighting is still continuing by Israelis against Hezbollah.   

As far as I know, Israel couldn't negotiate a deal to end hezbollah but instead negotiated a deal to only move hezbollah north of the litani and not allow new weapon supplies, but it did not mention any ideas of disarming hezbollah north of the litani. This was the ceasefire terms agreed upon both sides.   

While it would have been better for Lebanese and for Israelis to have a deal ensuring disarming Hezbollah as a foreign backed militia in Lebanon, this was not the deal Israel was achieved.   

Ever since the ceasefire, Israel has continued attacks on what it claims are hezbollah targets, but they are doing so even north of the Litani river where the deal that both sides agreed to did not mention that hezbollah can't operate there.   

I'm afraid this will do nothing but put anyone who opposes hezbollah from the Lebanese side in a bad position because this would only prove that you can't trust israeli ceasefires and terms. This will only give hezbollah more reasons to remain legitimate and will dismiss any Lebanese efforts to take control.

[link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/israel-hezbollah-syria-ceasefire-gaza-world-central-kitchen/)

&gt; An Israeli airstrike on a car in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed five people, including employees of World Central Kitchen. The charity said it was ""urgently seeking more details"" after Israel's military said it targeted a WCK worker who was part of the Hamas attack that sparked the war.

&gt; Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites along Syria's border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said Saturday, testing a fragile, days-old ceasefire that has seen continued sporadic fire.

&gt; The military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria into Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect, which the military said was a violation of its terms. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities or Hezbollah.

Hezbollah smuggling arms is a clear violation of ceasefire terms

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence, who prevented holocaust survivors from seeking refuge in the British Mandate.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted. Please research the ways Palestinians are treated in Lebanon and Jordan, where they are banned from certain professions, from owning property, from having full citizenship, all so they can be used as a political tool to put pressure on Israel.

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things.

Yet, despite this significant offer, none of the 101 hostages have been successfully returned so far. What makes this even more perplexing is the clear evidence that some of the hostages are being sheltered and cared for by Gazan civilians. This raises an unsettling question: how could a father, who has the chance to secure safety, a better future for his family, and an improved quality of life, choose instead to keep a hostage? 

This decision defies logic on multiple levels. It is not just about the economic or material benefits offered by Israel. The offer promises a lifeline, an escape from the hardships and dangers that many Gazan civilians face daily. Accepting such an offer would theoretically guarantee safety from ongoing conflicts, access to better healthcare and education, and a future of stability. Yet, the fact that no one has taken advantage of this opportunity suggests a deeper, more troubling dynamic at play.

It leads me to consider whether hatred toward Israelis surpasses the love for their own children among some Gazans. Is the hostility so deeply ingrained that it eclipses even the instinctual drive to protect and provide for their families? This possibility is deeply unsettling, as it speaks to a cycle of animosity that overrides self-preservation and the pursuit of a better life.

I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

People deny this is rooted in antisemitism and I want to believe they’re accurate, but in our community, we just can’t come up with any other reason!

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

Israelis often feel they're unfairly targeted for their nationality and that you if you're Israeli or shows any Israeli culture literally anywhere, you'll receive harsh criticism, if not outright hatred.



This is absolutely the case. You simply can't even mention Israel at all, or talk about the cutlure of Tel Aviv or Haifa today, without people directly saying that it's all Palestinian land, you're all settlers, etc. It's simply impossible to just share you like Hebrew music or modern Israeli couscous without people bringing up the conflict.


This is especially the case if you're in any context with many people from Middle Eastern, Arab or Muslim people. They aren't known to tolerate people saying they're Israeli.


The same is also true for left-wing activist groups in the West.



It feels really unfair because most other nationalities and ethnicities can simply talk about where they're from without getting an automatic harsh reaction, but they can't. Their very existance is political.



While it's often definitely very related to antisemitism, it's also often motivated by something else, namely, geopolitics and ethnic conflicts.



The thing is, the legitimacy of the State of Israel is not uninamous. Some believe it's not a legitimate state, and it's all an illegal occupation of the sovereign country of Palestine.


You might personally believe it's outrageous and unacceptable, but it's most likely because you grew up in a context where Israel being a state isn't questioned.


But in the Arab World for example most people don't believe Israel is a legitimate state.


But the thing is, the same treatment is often given to people from other disputed or unrecognised regions or states.



For example Abkhazia, it's a partially recognised state in the Caucasus claimed by Georgia as its autonomous region. It declared secession after an ethnic conflict in the 1990s and most of the world doesn't recognise it, except for Russia.


The thing is that the same applies to Abkhazians and any, even apolitical posts about Abkhazia.



If you want to share anything happening in modern day Abkhazia, for example about some caves found there, or about their recent protests there, or their food and culture, people would inevitably bring up Georgia.





And in fact, the vast majority of people will be on the opposing side, and they won't have many people defending them and if not being on their side, at least trying to bring up nuance.


[Ironically, this happens even for people who are themselves citizens of an unrecognised state.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kosovo/comments/1eoar1h/i_want_to_relocate_from_abkhazia_to_kosovo_how_is/)


The problem isn't just that Georgians outnumber Abkhazians (like the Arab World outnumbers Israel) but rather that people that are not directly tied to the conflict will automatically take a side because this will be seen as a proxy for their politics in general. For Abkhazia, the major Western powers (for example the EU) massively support Georgia, and people in the West are against Abkhazia because they believe backing Georgia means being against Russian imperialism.


I've seen it myself, any people who try to bring any nuance to this conflict, even if they're Abkhazian themselves, are accused of being pro Russian. Same with Israel too, in some cases.


Meanwhile, for Israel, left-wing activist circles believe that Israel is a settler colonial state, therefore backing Palestinians at all times is backing decolonization.



Both of these conflicts are actually much more complex than this simplistic narrative, but people don't actually try to learn that, they take sides automatically based on some narrative they've heard.


But because of this politization, merely saying you live in Israel or Abkhazia or are Abkhazian, as opposed to Georgian for example, is seen as itself a political statement.


If you live in Sukhumi and you say you're Abkhazian, even though it's the norm in your society, and saying you're Georgian is as unacceptable as a Georgian saying they're Russian, you're told that if you want to participate in the modern world, you should say you're Georgian and live in Georgia. The same is true for Israelis. If you live in Jaffa, how can you say it's an Israeli city? And use this symbol 🇮🇱 which is very political? For the Palestinians whose family is from there, it can be offensive.


And yes, you can be seen as a settler because the state you live in is seen as illegitimate.


This is very problematic.




All that often also happens with people from other disputed regions or states (Kosovo, South Ossetia, Northern Cyprus, Crimea, Kashmir, Tibet, etc).



Personally, I feel like in both cases, this approach doesn't necessarily help people to actually resolve ethnic conflicts. Instead of actually trying to build ties and create a solution that'll satisfy everyone, for example by strengthening the opposition. For example pro Palestinian people could've supported the Israeli opposition and the Israeli diaspora itself could've been supportive of a Palestinian state and even a right of return. But no, instead, we obsess over the legality of borders and the legitimacy of states, which means people on the opposite side see us as an existential threat to their existance.









We say we're modern people but in reality we're still tribal creatures, unfortunately.


Geopolitics, governments, state sovereignity and independence is unfortunately very ingrained in all of us and it's arguably like modern day religion.



It's sad to fight against this because this doesn't become merely discrimination, but also a geopolitical opinion opposing this state, and it's very hard to draw the lines over what's acceptable and what's not. But often times, people who say that racism is unacceptable still say unacceptable things merely because of the nationality of the person.



**However, unfortunately, this is something that's very common right now and is seen as the natural thing to do. So I've created this post to try to explain the logic of those that oppose anyone automatically if they say they're ""Israelis"", to understand their motivations, to know how to possibly fight against them, and also to oppose similar situations in the Western World, where entire identities become politicised.**



In my opinion, we should really deconstruct the idea of states and nations if we actually want to achieve world peace, or at least strive towards it.


I think we should be much more mindful about how national identities shape our worldview and how people from ""disputed regions"" might still be first and foremost people and we should try to look beyond merely borders and nations, be it recognised or not.




I also believe we shouldn't see the world merely through a lense of ""states"" and ""nations"". I believe the videos and maps about ""X fun thing in every country in the world"" (for example food, music, architecture, fun facts, etc) should also include people without states or with disputed states and that it shouldn't be seen as inherently political. So yeah, including Israel, Palestine, Abkhazia, Tibet, Hawaii, Ingushetia, Tamil Nadu, Jewish diaspora etc. If our world wasn't so fixated on ""countries"", aka, sovereign states, these things would've been much less problematic.

I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

People deny this is rooted in antisemitism and I want to believe they’re accurate, but in our community, we just can’t come up with any other reason! So if you are Anti-Zionist, what do you think Zionism is? Do we not have the right to self define? Is the definition offensive to you?

Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence, who prevented holocaust survivors from seeking refuge in the British Mandate.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted. Please research the ways Palestinians are treated in Lebanon and Jordan, where they are banned from certain professions, from owning property, from having full citizenship, all so they can be used as a political tool to put pressure on Israel.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence, who prevented holocaust survivors from seeking refuge in the British Mandate.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted. Please research the ways Palestinians are treated in Lebanon and Jordan, where they are banned from certain professions, from owning property, from having full citizenship, all so they can be used as a political tool to put pressure on Israel.

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it?

After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

What they do not realise is that the opposite is true. Not only is defeat possible, but in Gaza, they are winning.

For one, countless anaylsts, including those in Israel have commented that Israel has already lost the war. And that it cannot beat Hamas or the Palestinian Joint-Operations Room.

[As early as last month,](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/israel-losing-netanyahu-wont-back-down-his-war-aims) the British defence think tank reported that:

&gt; Israel is not achieving its war aims against Hamas. First, it has only obtained a handful of the hostages. Some have been killed; the fates of many others are still unknown.

Second, Hamas has not been destroyed. Destruction of a terrorist organisation is difficult to measure. Some point to leadership decapitation. However, as Jenna Jordan has pointed out, attriting terrorist leaders seldom brings about their organisations’ collapse. Factors such as popular support, ideology and organisational structure play bigger roles in deciding these groups’ fates. Another measure used to determine if a terrorist group has been destroyed is if its territorial sphere has been reduced or removed. Israel has failed to deprive Hamas of the territory it governed prior to the war. Hamas has been battered in Gaza, but it is still a political force to be reckoned with. Unaffiliated Palestinian clans have refused to join in a post-war reconstruction effort for fear of retaliation by Hamas. Third, Israel has not been able to secure its borders. While it has regained control over some border crossings, the underground infrastructure that has allowed Hamas to engage in smuggling weapons and carrying out attacks is still in place.

[Analdou Agency reported that a former Mossad chief had stated that Israel was unequovically losing the war in Gaza.](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-on-losing-end-in-gaza-war-former-mossad-deputy-chief/3223179). Even Zionist publishers like [JP reported this](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-803955).

[As CNN has reported, Hamas has remained wholly combat effective.](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/08/middleeast/gaza-israel-hamas-battalions-invs-intl/). This is a pattern that staretd early in the war. By December, the IDF was declaring most Hamas batallions to have been dismantled.

This was quickly revealed to be a propaganda lie. As in early 2024, reports emerged that Hamas had begun rehabilitating its batallions in North Gaza. Reports from the Neo-Conservative think tank isw argued that as much as 80% of Hamas' fighting strength was restored. 

According to the isw's report on MArch 27th, they argue that this means Palestinian fighters ""retain  significant degree of combat effectiveness in the area, despite continued Israeli clearing efforts around Gaza City."" and that ""The return of Israeli forces to [Zaytoun] suggests that Palestinian militias continue to operate there similar to how these militias still have a presence in other portions of the northern Gaza Strip.""

We can also check pretty much every battle in Gaza to see how this is true.

The first battle in Gaza was the battle of Beit Hanoun. Despite IDF claims, they never occupied the city. And the battle is considered as having ended in a Palestinian victory. The isw reported that when the IDF left in December, the P-JOR continued effective control over Beit Hanoun. Beit Hanoun was used as a base to attack the IDF and send rockets into Israel, demonstrating that teh IDF had failed to defeat the JOR in Beit Hanoun.

Then we have the First Battle of Jabalia. As the isw reported, Hamas retained control of Jabalia after Israel withdrew in May. 

&gt; ""These points taken together reflect the degree to which Hamas and other Palestinian militias remain combat effective in and around Jabalia. Hamas and the other militias will almost certainly resume their efforts to reconstitute there as the IDF units have left.""

Then we have the Battle of Shuja'iyya. Though the IDF declared victory here, heavy casualties forced them to withdraw and as al-Jazeera reported, Palestinians retained control of the city. Further evidence of Palestinain control is that several months later, the IDF returned to the region to try and wrestle control away from the JOR.

This 2nd battle was just as disastrous for the IDF. After retreating in July, Hamas and the PIJ retained dominance in the city. Again, al-Jazeera reported how this had occured. But not stopping there, when the IDF withdrew in videos from the area one could see Palestinian militants with guns in their hands standing around in broad daylight. Alongside this, government officials working for the P-JOR immediately remerged in the city, as if they had never left, and reasserted doubly Palestinian control in the region.

Then we have the siege of Khan Yunis. The first Israeli assualt ended in abject failure. so great was the routing of the IDF they withdrew from all of southern Gaza. Khan Yunis itself remained under the control of the Joint Operations Room. Again, as reported by the isw. The 2nd and 3rd battles ended in much the same way and in far shorter timespans.

Then comes al-Qarara. By all acounts, a Palestinian victory.The isw reported that Israel was defeated in al-Qarara. They had failed to achieve any of their aims. P-JOR remained in control. No high ranking militants were found or killed, and accordinng to anaylsts, Hamas remained combat effective in the region.

This is how every battle that has ended thus far has gone. Israel went in, killed civilians for a few weeks. Ran into resistance, tried to fight back, upon seeing heavy casualties retreated with Palestine still in control.

Yet, despite this significant offer, none of the 101 hostages have been successfully returned so far. What makes this even more perplexing is the clear evidence that some of the hostages are being sheltered and cared for by Gazan civilians. This raises an unsettling question: how could a father, who has the chance to secure safety, a better future for his family, and an improved quality of life, choose instead to keep a hostage? 

This decision defies logic on multiple levels. It is not just about the economic or material benefits offered by Israel. The offer promises a lifeline, an escape from the hardships and dangers that many Gazan civilians face daily. Accepting such an offer would theoretically guarantee safety from ongoing conflicts, access to better healthcare and education, and a future of stability. Yet, the fact that no one has taken advantage of this opportunity suggests a deeper, more troubling dynamic at play.

It leads me to consider whether hatred toward Israelis surpasses the love for their own children among some Gazans. Is the hostility so deeply ingrained that it eclipses even the instinctual drive to protect and provide for their families? This possibility is deeply unsettling, as it speaks to a cycle of animosity that overrides self-preservation and the pursuit of a better life.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

I’m not getting why,if not for antisemitism, are people are so anti-Zionist and why this conflict is so focussed on. I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

So if you are Anti-Zionist, what do you think Zionism is? Do we not have the right to self define? Is the definition offensive to you?

Although there are still extremists and fundamentalists among them, and of course I won’t do the disservice you did by focusing on the extremism and atrocities done by the government of Israel and make collective conclusions about the Jewish people. 

Give the Palestinians the same safe haven, the same resources for building their society, and there will be no reason for resistance groups to exist and prevail. Social progress will then be given a chance to flourish. It will take time, however and there are obstacles that also need to be dealt with (e.g. Iran’s theocratic dictatorial regime).

Bombing their entire infrastructure and in turn,  killing, injuring, orphaning, and displacing their whole population is not a solution. It’s a problem in itself if there is the smallest trace of empathy for these people.

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.



Anyways, I could go on, but I think my general point has been made…",The Palestinian cause has already won in the court of public opinion,0.52,13,0,12/1/2024 22:32,-1.0,Pro-Palestine
5474,lzu5759,1,"&gt;Are you guaranteeing their return to their homes after the war?

That's for Israel to decide and is incumbent on a subsequent deradicalization of the Palestinian people similar to what happened to Japan and Germany with the Marshall Plan. Sadly without a concerted effort, I suspect another terrorist organization will emerge - again funded by Iran or Qatar - to fill the vacuum of Hamas which will only perpetrate more violence.

To be clear, I support a two state solution and condemn the illegal settlements in the West Bank. Why haven't you addressed any of the points I've made about Hamas protecting Palestinians in their tunnels or their deliberate martyrdom? Surrendering and returning all of the hostages seems like the first step toward peace; I find it telling that's never championed by those on the pro-Palestinian side.

Why is Israel subjected to this much scrutiny by the U.N. compared to numerous other countries committing worse atrocities like Russia that's invading a sovereign democratic nation and killing tens of thousands of its people to reestablish the former Soviet Union? Because the bias of antisemitism is strong and an unwillingness of Arab majority countries to not recognize Israel's legitimacy still rings true almost 80 years later.

&gt;Israel has killed plenty of innocents and has counted almost every male including children it has killed as ""terrorists"" despite there being plenty of evidence of the contrary.

Again, it's war and war is hell.

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things.

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.",It's Barack Obama's fault that the Peace Process collapsed. ,0.41,0,0,12/2/2024 8:35,0.0,Neutral

The fact is that Israel never had any interest in annexing Gaza. Only fools believed otherwise (mostly because of propaganda).",IsraelPalestine,12/1/2024 13:24,1h42p22,Brentford2024,0,8,0,True,9/11/2024 7:36,0,0,1,404,405,1,"My argument is if the former top Israel war cabinet had considered all of Gaza Strip to be part of Israeli land (some call it Greater Israel ), then it would not have flatten much of Gaza. If you think Gaza belongs to you, your property, you would not have flatten much of Gaza. I still think the current top Israeli leadership also doesnt want to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip.

1. Ben-Gurion and early zionists may have commented on Greater Israel. But time has changed, the current top leadership is no Ben-Gurion. Similarly, Trump is no Biden. The government policies will change depending on the leader and changes with the time.

2. Daniella Weiss, Ben-Gvir, Smotrich and other extreme right wings may be salivating at the idea of re-establishing Gush Katif settlements (formerly near Khan Yunis) in the southern Gaza Strip. But none of them were part of the former top Israeli war cabinet, and even currently they do not direct or lead the war. They may try, but this is not official government policy. 

I am trying to explain that is/was not the intention of Israel/IDF to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip. It’s kinda an ancient war maxime (idk what is it called), but you dont destroy the land/ all the buildings if you want to conquer itand considered that land belongs to you.

3. During WW2, Germany didnt destroy Paris. They tried when they were losing and evacuating, but not at the start. They wanted Paris to be intact. And you would too if you are conquering Paris. There is a suggestion (some might dispute it) that the German leader who cannot be named during WW2, did not REALLY wanted to conquer Britain. After defeating France, Germany thought Britain would make peace. There were lots of destruction during the Battle of Britain especially London.

4. US dropped nuclear bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, flatten them. US had no intention of permanently conquering Japan. US never saw Japan as part of US land. US wanted to end the war, and thought using nuclear bomb will do that, and it did, Japan surrendered. US was in Japan for a bit to sort things out then quickly handed over to a transitional Japanese government. US had no intention of conquering Japan.

5. US dropped more than 7.5 million tons of bombs in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. US had no intention of permanently conquering Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos. It’s easier to completely destroy something you dont want/need and even easier if you are not the one going to clean up the mess later down the line. See the pattern….Israel has no intention of funding the rebuilding of Gaza with Israeli money. But that doesnt mean Israel will prevent others from funding the rebuilding of Gaza, mainly from donations from USA, Europe, Arab, Muslim countries and rest of international world but not Israel.

6. I dont have the facts, can someone check how was the six days war fought in Jerusalem ? If my theory is correct, my prediction would be, there should be minimal destruction in Jerusalem. Israel wants/wanted Jerusalem, and to be intact, not flatten. See the difference with Gaza Strip. 

7. What is Jerusalem worth ? Saladdin replied Nothing, then said Everything. I am not saying its historically accurate, i wanted to emphasize how people think. Jerusalem is worth nothing and everything. You wont want to destroy something that valuable. 

8. At the beginning of the Ukraine war, did you noticed the Russia’s attack was very tactical and calculated…lets attack the telecommunication system, military bases, military airbase, railway lines etc… I think at this moment, Putin really thought Ukraine was part of Russia, so he wasnt intending to flatten Ukraine. But Putin’s invasion plans didnt go as plan, F£*&amp; it… then Russia started to change tactic and started to obliterate cities like Bahmut, Mariupol, Kharkiv, etc... Well, if Putin cant have Ukraine, nobody else can…. might as well flatten it. 

9. Even if any US states try to secede from USA, the US military is unlikely going to flatten their cities. Because Washington would have concluded that is part of US land, we shouldnt cause that much destruction. Not to mention the bad press, criticism, protests, etc… the people there are American citizens and they might have family and friends in other parts of the USA. If its not US land, well… I can tell you the approach will be very different.

10. These intentions are not static, and can change. Trump probably has a few ideas of his own and will start making changes next year. Currently, there is rumors that part of Gaza Strip in the north might be turned into a buffer zone by IDF. I think the reason is for security purpose, not for the purpose to annex and not to settle in Gaza.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.",It's Barack Obama's fault that the Peace Process collapsed. ,0.41,0,0,12/2/2024 8:35,0.0,Neutral

The Geneva Convention are about occupation.  Most cities aren't razed during occupation but during active fighting.  Geneva doesn't really address the issue at all.

Which is a Western power razing a city.

I disagree.  As I said I think they do realize but no there won't be.

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

I don't think the Israelis are trying to kill the Palestinians because they are Palestinians. I actually don't believe they care much about that specific identity or harbor real anti-Palestinian hate. They don't see them. The Palestinians don't matter. The Israelis simply want to kill or get rid of the Palestinians because they are *there* and *not Jewish* and not interested in completely capitulating to a Jewish supremacy between the River and the Sea despite Palestinians being \~50% of the population.

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.",It's Barack Obama's fault that the Peace Process collapsed. ,0.41,0,0,12/2/2024 8:35,0.0,Neutral

This decision defies logic on multiple levels. It is not just about the economic or material benefits offered by Israel. The offer promises a lifeline, an escape from the hardships and dangers that many Gazan civilians face daily. Accepting such an offer would theoretically guarantee safety from ongoing conflicts, access to better healthcare and education, and a future of stability. Yet, the fact that no one has taken advantage of this opportunity suggests a deeper, more troubling dynamic at play.

It leads me to consider whether hatred toward Israelis surpasses the love for their own children among some Gazans. Is the hostility so deeply ingrained that it eclipses even the instinctual drive to protect and provide for their families? This possibility is deeply unsettling, as it speaks to a cycle of animosity that overrides self-preservation and the pursuit of a better life. Such a choice not only perpetuates suffering but also raises important questions about the role of ideology, community pressure, and fear in shaping these decisions.

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

I know the general idea was to create a place where Jews would be safe, and I suppose that's the main reason to keep a Jewish majority. 

But are there other reasons?  Maybe some scriptural basis for needing to be majority Jewish?  I can't find any so far.  There's certainly a scriptural basis for the idea of Jews having a *connection* to the land of Israel, but there's nothing I've found in the Jewish tradition/scriture that says Jews need to be in the majority. 

Or maybe something totally different? I know Israel was *planned* as a Jewish state by the UN partition plan, same as Pakistan was planned as a Muslim state.. 

I'm not challenging the idea that it should be majority Jewish. (There's basically no such thing as a state whose native ethnic people has not remained in the majority -- France, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Germany, especially Japan, etc., all remain something like 85%-95% ethnically homogeneous.  So I don't see anything strange about Jews being the majority in Israel.)

Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence, who prevented holocaust survivors from seeking refuge in the British Mandate.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted. Please research the ways Palestinians are treated in Lebanon and Jordan, where they are banned from certain professions, from owning property, from having full citizenship, all so they can be used as a political tool to put pressure on Israel.

Yet, despite this significant offer, none of the 101 hostages have been successfully returned so far. What makes this even more perplexing is the clear evidence that some of the hostages are being sheltered and cared for by Gazan civilians. This raises an unsettling question: how could a father, who has the chance to secure safety, a better future for his family, and an improved quality of life, choose instead to keep a hostage? 

This decision defies logic on multiple levels. It is not just about the economic or material benefits offered by Israel. The offer promises a lifeline, an escape from the hardships and dangers that many Gazan civilians face daily. Accepting such an offer would theoretically guarantee safety from ongoing conflicts, access to better healthcare and education, and a future of stability. Yet, the fact that no one has taken advantage of this opportunity suggests a deeper, more troubling dynamic at play.

It leads me to consider whether hatred toward Israelis surpasses the love for their own children among some Gazans. Is the hostility so deeply ingrained that it eclipses even the instinctual drive to protect and provide for their families? This possibility is deeply unsettling, as it speaks to a cycle of animosity that overrides self-preservation and the pursuit of a better life.

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

There is unrest across the country and fighting and rumors of a coup attempt in Damascus, though it is not clear what is happening and that fighting may be against rebel cells.

As far as I am aware, Syria is not directly involved in the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon, but Assad's government is hostile to Israel and one of Hezbollah and Iran's major allies. There is speculation that the rebel attack may have been prompted by the military weakness of Hezbollah and Iran in the wake of conflict with Israel. Syria borders Israel and is only 30 miles from the West Bank at its closest point.

At a minimum, conflict in Syria will further deplete the resources of the Iranian-led alliance and reduce their ability to engage in Lebanon or Gaza. More Hezbollah forces may move into Syria after the ceasefire, or maybe Hezbollah is too depleted to send any more support. In the extreme case Assad may fall and be replaced by another general from within his faction, or by some sort of rebel government. I have no idea what the implications of regime change would be. I don't think it is likely that conflict will spill into Israel directly because the Golan Heights border is well defended, but renewed conflict might change the situation in Lebanon or on Israel's northern border.

Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence, who prevented holocaust survivors from seeking refuge in the British Mandate.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted. Please research the ways Palestinians are treated in Lebanon and Jordan, where they are banned from certain professions, from owning property, from having full citizenship, all so they can be used as a political tool to put pressure on Israel.

I would say the important objectionable aspect of Zionism is that it sees the achievement of its goals to be a moral imperative regardless of the consent of the Palestinians. Inherent to Zionism is the belief that the Jewish People have a *right* to Palestine.

Quick reminder ""self-determination"" does not give you a right to take land from someone else.

&gt;And this isn’t the only conflict in the world. It’s not even the largest by people killed or involved.

This argument has been made thousands of times before but the answer hasn't changed. The Israel Palestine conflict is different because Israel is backed by the U.S.

The war in Sudan is devastating, but the U.S. isn't sending billions of dollars of weapons to Sudan. The U.S. isn't shielding either the SAF or RSF in the UN.

So here is my proposal: Treat Israel exactly the same. Stop sending weapons. Investigate human rights abuses. If Israel refuses to cooperate sanction it like we would any other country.

You are right that the response is different, but by and large the response is different *in favor of Israel*.

&gt;Why is the focus on Ukraine minimal when it is one if the most despicable wars ever with the potential of the collapse of Western society?

Because the U.S. already is supporting Ukraine.

&gt;in our community, we just can’t come up with any other reason!

I think it is worth thinking about the biases in your community and the narratives that it unconsciously adopts. Israel has promoted the idea that to oppose Israel must be antisemitic. It has pushed this narrative very strongly because it helps Israel to discredit its detractors, especially in Jewish circles. Anti-Zionist Jews are targeted and attacked as self-hating Jews, or even called ""pretend"" Jews.

If you never considered how the difference between U.S./Israel relations and U.S./Russia relations would impact the approach to the conflict in the U.S. (and the world considering the U.S.'s global influence) then I think there is a blind spot in your thinking about Israel.",IsraelPalestine,12/2/2024 19:40,1h4mvic,SilasRhodes,1,1,0,True,10/1/2016 10:48,1236,1054,10563,123341,136194,59,"I grew up for 40 years thinking mass antisemitism was a thing of the past. I’d still like to believe that but much of what has happened in response to this conflict makes that hard. I’m not getting why,if not for antisemitism, are people are so anti-Zionist and why this conflict is so focussed on. I live in a major city in, now full of antisemitic graffiti and regular attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and areas. This may have happened rarely before the conflict, but now it’s an every day reality.  

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement? 

And this isn’t the only conflict in the world. It’s not even the largest by people killed or involved. Here is a map that shows all current conflicts. https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.",It's Barack Obama's fault that the Peace Process collapsed. ,0.41,0,0,12/2/2024 8:35,1.0,Pro-Israel

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

The Palestinians should have just negotiated? The Israeli government, which is the longest serving government, and has been in power for most of the time since 1948 doesn't even believe in a Palestinian state or the Palestinian people. This is who they want them to negotiate with, a side whose charter calls for a single Jewish land between the river and the sea? C'mon.
