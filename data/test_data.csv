Israel has invested *billions* of dollars in defensive infrastructure, such as missile interceptors (the Iron Dome), detection systems, bomb shelters, etc. Tens of thousands of rockets have been fired into Israel since the start of the war, yet very few (but not 0) civilians have died. 

I don’t understand the inference that anti-Israel people seem to make, that it’s “unfair” that Israel loses fewer people than the other side. Like, would you like us to turn off all the defence systems? Shut down the Iron Dome, silence the air raid sirens? In WW2, an exponentially higher number of German civilians were killed by the Allies in the mission to defeat the Axis powers than Allied civilians, same with Japanese civilians.

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.



Anyways, I could go on, but I think my general point has been made…

Fast forward a few months and I ended up in a sales role joining a security startup which has a huge presence in Israel, and I ended up working v v closely with people in Israel for my job. Long story short I realized soon after joining how Israeli the office was (didn’t really get it when I was signing the offer. Anyway I really really love working there and now I’m bffs with my coworkers who love me. The job has actually been healing for me. I don’t mention my political views at all at work - but my coworkers do a lot. And I try and empathize  with them and hear them / hold space for them. I’m not personally affected by this conflict end of day. But how come no one feels bad for the thousands and thousands  of kids being killed - and how can that keep being justified. I’m mostly now of the opinion that of course Israel should defend itself but I can’t justify the killing of so many innocents. It would make my life easy if I just could go over to the Israeli side - cos then I could truly be open at work. But I guess I’m wondering from this sub - how should I think about this issue?

The offensive continues to have momentum and it is unclear how much territory will change hands. There is unrest across the country and fighting and rumors of a coup attempt in Damascus, though it is not clear what is happening and that fighting may be against rebel cells.

As far as I am aware, Syria is not directly involved in the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon, but Assad's government is hostile to Israel and one of Hezbollah and Iran's major allies. There is speculation that the rebel attack may have been prompted by the military weakness of Hezbollah and Iran in the wake of conflict with Israel. Syria borders Israel and is only 30 miles from the West Bank at its closest point.

At a minimum, conflict in Syria will further deplete the resources of the Iranian-led alliance and reduce their ability to engage in Lebanon or Gaza. More Hezbollah forces may move into Syria after the ceasefire, or maybe Hezbollah is too depleted to send any more support. In the extreme case Assad may fall and be replaced by another general from within his faction, or by some sort of rebel government. I have no idea what the implications of regime change would be. I don't think it is likely that conflict will spill into Israel directly because the Golan Heights border is well defended, but renewed conflict might change the situation in Lebanon or on Israel's northern border.

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.



Anyways, I could go on, but I think my general point has been made…

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.

https://x.com/MTVEnglishNews/status/1863159187968045521   

It seems fighting is still continuing by Israelis against Hezbollah.   

As far as I know, Israel couldn't negotiate a deal to end hezbollah but instead negotiated a deal to only move hezbollah north of the litani and not allow new weapon supplies, but it did not mention any ideas of disarming hezbollah north of the litani. This was the ceasefire terms agreed upon both sides.   

While it would have been better for Lebanese and for Israelis to have a deal ensuring disarming Hezbollah as a foreign backed militia in Lebanon, this was not the deal Israel was achieved.   

Ever since the ceasefire, Israel has continued attacks on what it claims are hezbollah targets, but they are doing so even north of the Litani river where the deal that both sides agreed to did not mention that hezbollah can't operate there.   

I'm afraid this will do nothing but put anyone who opposes hezbollah from the Lebanese side in a bad position because this would only prove that you can't trust israeli ceasefires and terms. This will only give hezbollah more reasons to remain legitimate and will dismiss any Lebanese efforts to take control.     
   
   
EDIT: From one of the replies:

[link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/israel-hezbollah-syria-ceasefire-gaza-world-central-kitchen/)

&gt; An Israeli airstrike on a car in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed five people, including employees of World Central Kitchen. The charity said it was ""urgently seeking more details"" after Israel's military said it targeted a WCK worker who was part of the Hamas attack that sparked the war.

&gt; Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites along Syria's border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said Saturday, testing a fragile, days-old ceasefire that has seen continued sporadic fire.

&gt; The military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria into Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect, which the military said was a violation of its terms. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities or Hezbollah.

Hezbollah smuggling arms is a clear violation of ceasefire terms

Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence, who prevented holocaust survivors from seeking refuge in the British Mandate.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted. Please research the ways Palestinians are treated in Lebanon and Jordan, where they are banned from certain professions, from owning property, from having full citizenship, all so they can be used as a political tool to put pressure on Israel.

The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.



Anyways, I could go on, but I think my general point has been made…

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

1480,m03bp7a,1,I have the easiest solution to ending the war in Israel/Palestine: make both governments secular. Done.

If you think Gaza belongs to you, your property, you would not have flatten much of Gaza. I still think the current top Israeli leadership also doesnt want to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip.

1. Ben-Gurion and early zionists may have commented on Greater Israel. But time has changed, the current top leadership is no Ben-Gurion. Similarly, Trump is no Biden. The government policies will change depending on the leader and changes with the time.

2. Daniella Weiss, Ben-Gvir, Smotrich and other extreme right wings may be salivating at the idea of re-establishing Gush Katif settlements (formerly near Khan Yunis) in the southern Gaza Strip. But none of them were part of the former top Israeli war cabinet, and even currently they do not direct or lead the war. They may try, but this is not official government policy. 

I am trying to explain that is/was not the intention of Israel/IDF to permanently annex all of Gaza Strip. It’s kinda an ancient war maxime (idk what is it called), but you dont destroy the land/ all the buildings if you want to conquer itand considered that land belongs to you.

3. During WW2, Germany didnt destroy Paris. They tried when they were losing and evacuating, but not at the start. They wanted Paris to be intact. And you would too if you are conquering Paris. There is a suggestion (some might dispute it) that the German leader who cannot be named during WW2, did not REALLY wanted to conquer Britain. After defeating France, Germany thought Britain would make peace. There were lots of destruction during the Battle of Britain especially London.

4. US dropped nuclear bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, flatten them. US had no intention of permanently conquering Japan. US never saw Japan as part of US land. US wanted to end the war, and thought using nuclear bomb will do that, and it did, Japan surrendered. US was in Japan for a bit to sort things out then quickly handed over to a transitional Japanese government. US had no intention of conquering Japan.

5. US dropped more than 7.5 million tons of bombs in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. US had no intention of permanently conquering Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos. It’s easier to completely destroy something you dont want/need and even easier if you are not the one going to clean up the mess later down the line. See the pattern….Israel has no intention of funding the rebuilding of Gaza with Israeli money. But that doesnt mean Israel will prevent others from funding the rebuilding of Gaza, mainly from donations from USA, Europe, Arab, Muslim countries and rest of international world but not Israel.

6. I dont have the facts, can someone check how was the six days war fought in Jerusalem ? If my theory is correct, my prediction would be, there should be minimal destruction in Jerusalem. Israel wants/wanted Jerusalem, and to be intact, not flatten. See the difference with Gaza Strip. 

7. What is Jerusalem worth ? Saladdin replied Nothing, then said Everything. I am not saying its historically accurate, i wanted to emphasize how people think. Jerusalem is worth nothing and everything. You wont want to destroy something that valuable. 

8. At the beginning of the Ukraine war, did you noticed the Russia’s attack was very tactical and calculated…lets attack the telecommunication system, military bases, military airbase, railway lines etc… I think at this moment, Putin really thought Ukraine was part of Russia, so he wasnt intending to flatten Ukraine. But Putin’s invasion plans didnt go as plan, F£*&amp; it… then Russia started to change tactic and started to obliterate cities like Bahmut, Mariupol, Kharkiv, etc... Well, if Putin cant have Ukraine, nobody else can…. might as well flatten it. 

9. Even if any US states try to secede from USA, the US military is unlikely going to flatten their cities. Because Washington would have concluded that is part of US land, we shouldnt cause that much destruction. Not to mention the bad press, criticism, protests, etc… the people there are American citizens and they might have family and friends in other parts of the USA. If its not US land, well… I can tell you the approach will be very different.

10. These intentions are not static, and can change. Trump probably has a few ideas of his own and will start making changes next year. Currently, there is rumors that part of Gaza Strip in the north might be turned into a buffer zone by IDF. I think the reason is for security purpose, not for the purpose to annex and not to settle in Gaza. And I dont think it will be permanent either.

Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted.

There's certainly a scriptural basis for the idea of Jews having a *connection* to the land of Israel, but there's nothing I've found in the Jewish tradition/scriture that says Jews need to be in the majority. 

Or maybe something totally different? I know Israel was *planned* as a Jewish state by the UN partition plan, same as Pakistan was planned as a Muslim state.. 

I'm not challenging the idea that it should be majority Jewish.

So I don't see anything strange about Jews being the majority in Israel.) 

So I'm not asking ""why"" as a way to criticize Israel.  I'm searching for all the possible reasons why any stakeholders want to keep it majority Jewish.

169,m06l1kk,1,"""Settler colonialism"" &amp; ""ethnostate"" are hate labels created in the areas of political science, social science &amp; law by the oppression-ideology scholars, heavily funded by Qatar and other entities, who have swarmed into academia in recent decades. 

It's neo-Marxism, racialized Marxism, actually. Oppression ideology arises from Marxist and other socialist thinking where there's an oppressor class and a repressed class. The oppressors are evil and exploit the repressed underclass and feed parasitically off of them.

Modern oppression ideology racializes these ideas into racist constructs. (This is where the racial hatred of white people come from in recent years, where white men and women are treated as defective and owe atonement and reparations to black and brown peoples, regardless of their ancestry or what their forebears have done.)

In the areas of politics, law and social sciences, oppression ideology has taken forms expressed as hateful scholarship concepts like settler-colonialism and ethnostate and so on. These concepts are used to create or describe movements to ""violently decolonize"" regions of the world where whites have settled. And by ""violently decolonize"" I mean they espouse killing whites, like in Africa (the country formerly known as ""Rhodesia"" and now known as Zimbabwe and in South Africa) there are movements to wipe out the remaining whites.

These terms, and other racialized marxist ideations, have been weaponized against Israel by academic antisemites. They take several steps to apply them to Israel, like first deciding that Israelis are European whites (because a minority of Israeli Jews are descended those who returned from Europe after WWII) and not Semites/Levantine people.

The same antisemites who try to apply racialized settler-colonialism to demonize white heritage also claim that having a country for Jewish people to live is an ""ethnostate"" even though Jews are extremely ethnically diverse -- ranging from Black Ethiopian Jews to never-left-Israel natives to Jews from India, America &amp; so on. This is despite the fact that most nations are ethnically centered on one or a few heritage populations, from China and Japan to Germany.

The fact is that the oppression ideology based recent studies in politics, law &amp; social studies are all racist anti-white hatred and poor quality scholarship. The reason I say this is that they are applied &amp; built upon in extremely Eurocentric notions, as in stating their ideas in terms of radical hatred of European whites, as an indictment of European expansion and migration. 

In fact, the application of settler-colonialism seems to be applied exclusively to European expansion of the past few hundred years, ignoring all other human migration, empires, capliphates and dynasties in history.

For example, there's nothing implicitly wrong or incorrect with the basic concept of settler-colonialism. But to apply it strictly and obsessively to European expansion is to ignore all of the history of Islam. One of the most brutal, successful &amp; oppressive examples of settler-colonialism is the expansion of Islam out of the Arabian peninsula across the Levant region (where Israel lies) across N Africa and across the ME, up the Balkans &amp; across the Mediterranean to Spain. 

Basically, every wrongdoing in the ""settler-colonialism"" framework can be applied to Islamic-Arab expansion more than the European expansion, but the descendants of Arab Muslim settler-colonists are most of the very people accusing Europeans of it. For example, the Palestinian Arabs are descendants of the brutal settler-colonialism of the Levant, remnants of the invasion of Islamist Arabs as they swept across to N. Africa, raping, forcefully converting and killing along the way. 

Arab-Islamic settler-colonists heavily leveraged slavery to both repress locals and support their civilization's growth. In fact, the Ottoman Empire, the last great Islamic civilization, had to collapse after United States &amp; Europeans (who had started using chattel slavery for a few hundred years after Spain, which had been under Islamic rule for 800 years, introduced chattel slavery to Europe and the New World) abolished slavery among themselves and attacked and ended the Barbary Slave Trade in the 19th century.

The ""settler-colonial framework"" &amp; terms like ""ethnostate"" are the work that these racist Marxist antisemites &amp; anti-white minorities in academia, mostly disgruntled Muslims who pine for the return of a world ruled by a Global Islamic Caliphate, have weaponized against Europe, the U.S. and Israel in recent decades.

Their motivations and aims in what they do are evident in what they get from targeting wealthy nations with these smears: privileges, reparations, special treatment, diversity and inclusion quotas, immigration assistance and support, low-enforcement policing polices, and international aid -- vast amounts of international aid. 

In terms of Israel, the people claiming that Jews are ""settler-colonists""  also want to take what Jews have built in Israel and plunder it, when really, the Palestinian Arabs are settler-colonists who are resisting the return of Jews, the true ancestral indigenous people, to the land. 

Palestinian Arabs are the descendants of the first wave of (pre-modern) settler-colonists in the region who had plundered what was at the time a wealthy and connected Israel, and turned it to desert by destroying irrigation, settlements and forests, depopulating Israel, because the nomadic herding tribes who moved into the region out of Arabia preferred it that way.

Prior to the Islamic-Arab invasion and expansion, Israel's civilization had survived the invasion and conquest of many empires, from Greek and Roman to others. By desertifying Israel, the Arab nomadic herding tribes successfully depopulated it and made it easy to maintain control and ownership of it. Until Zionists began to return and reclaim the land to rebuild. 

You should know the terms about settler-colonialism and ethnostate and so on. 

These settler colonialism studies are to international law and politics what critical race theory is to U.S. law, politics and policing. They lie on a continuum of Marxist oppression ideologies that are the trend in academia supporting unchecked immigration/open borders, DEI and other reparations-minded agendas.

This is the newspeak of the academic &amp; cultural bubble that dominates in academia &amp; liberal circles today. If you don't know these terms you're believed to be part of the problem of white oppression of browns and blacks.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

The offensive continues to have momentum and it is unclear how much territory will change hands. There is unrest across the country and fighting and rumors of a coup attempt in Damascus, though it is not clear what is happening and that fighting may be against rebel cells.

As far as I am aware, Syria is not directly involved in the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon, but Assad's government is hostile to Israel and one of Hezbollah and Iran's major allies. There is speculation that the rebel attack may have been prompted by the military weakness of Hezbollah and Iran in the wake of conflict with Israel. Syria borders Israel and is only 30 miles from the West Bank at its closest point.

At a minimum, conflict in Syria will further deplete the resources of the Iranian-led alliance and reduce their ability to engage in Lebanon or Gaza. More Hezbollah forces may move into Syria after the ceasefire, or maybe Hezbollah is too depleted to send any more support. In the extreme case Assad may fall and be replaced by another general from within his faction, or by some sort of rebel government. I have no idea what the implications of regime change would be. I don't think it is likely that conflict will spill into Israel directly because the Golan Heights border is well defended, but renewed conflict might change the situation in Lebanon or on Israel's northern border.

Do people have any thoughts on what implications, if any, a renewed Syrian Civil War would have on the Israel/Palestine situation?

My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally.

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

Al-Husseini sought to leverage Germany's hostility towards Jews and the British to further Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist agendas. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1941, pledging Arab support for the Axis powers in exchange for promises to oppose the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also lobbied Nazi leaders to prevent Jewish refugees from escaping Europe to Palestine, advocating instead for their extermination within Nazi-controlled territories​



Al-Husseini was instrumental in recruiting Muslims to serve in the Nazi military, particularly the Waffen-SS. He played a role in forming the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, a unit composed largely of Bosnian Muslims. These forces were primarily deployed in the Balkans but shared the broader Nazi aim of targeting Jews and Allied forces. After the war, some former SS personnel found themselves fighting alongside Arab forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The wartime collaboration between Arab nationalists and fascist elements highlighted a shared hostility toward Zionism and the British Empire​



Even after the war, Arab states benefited from former Nazi military expertise, particularly in their efforts to combat the establishment of Israel. Many ex-SS officers and German military advisors were welcomed into Arab states to train their armies. This cooperation also marked the beginning of Soviet involvement, as the USSR initially supported Arab states against Israel by providing arms and strategic assistance during the early phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict​

To re-start the Peace Process, Netanyahu accepted a 2 state solution in Bar Ilan and later halted settlement construction, which damaged him in his Political Base

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.

I ended up not doing so due to personal reasons, but that’s another story.

On the other hand, I also spent a lot of time in countries neighbouring Israel, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as many other Arab countries in both the Gulf and North Africa, but have never been to Israel proper.

The reason why I bring all of this up is to kind of give context to where my perspective is coming from, and dismiss any accusation of having “gotten my news from TikTok,” which is a common rebuttal I see on Reddit and elsewhere.



My point is simple, as a student of media (Bernays, McLuhan, Chomsky, Baudrillard…) and having followed this conflict since 2011, I can honestly state that the way in which it is now depicted in the news, online, in social media, world events, and by celebrities, showcases a huge shift in perception that I’d never seen at any time prior. Global news is now local news.

Just today, I stumbled on a Instagram reel featuring DJ Khaled and Jimmy Fallon eating Palestinian food together on a late night talk show. I don’t happen to much like either of those people, but I know the demographics that they tailor/cater to, and if it has gotten to that level of popular culture (in America!), the Palestinian cause may prevail, and be the winning narrative.

I live in Europe, and have witnessed this change in real life here as well. The protests are huge, and are attended not just by fringe radical individuals as the news may sometimes portray, but by students, families, women and children, artists, regular looking people of all races - I’m speaking solely of cities I know locally, on a personal level, as well as the one I currently live in. The reason why I bring this up is because maybe this fact isn’t sufficiently documented in the news internationally . The will of the governments of the UK, France, Germany, etc. does NOT represent the will of its people and its culture, and the two should not be confused with one another.



With that said, I’m under no illusion that the ‘war’ may go on for quite a while, that many more people may die, and that more Palestinian land may be seized and annexed - and I can also imagine far worse possible outcomes than that. But the discourse of the Palestinian people will not be forgotten 10, 20, 30 years from now, because its mythology is noble and that of the IDF’s is not. Israel will become a pariah state, and Netanyahu will have done irreparable damage to the Jewish people both in Israel and internationally. Antisemitism is on the rise everywhere, but I guess that may have also been part of his plan, as it justifies the need for Israel.

My partner is not Jewish, I am. When we talked about Zionism right after October 7, he thought was a movement that some Jewish people think they’re superior. Many people on this thread seem to think they’re same.

However, the consensus in the Jewish and Zionist community, as taken from the Anti-Defamation League is “Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel.”

Nothing in there says anything about excluding anyone, superiority or any other hate terms. It’s simply that we believe Israel should exist and Jews have a right to live there and self determine. The diaspora at least tends to believe in a two state solution where Palestinian people also have the right to self determination. Any Israeli I know feels the same. 

I’m not understanding where the disconnect is; are we not allowed to self determine? Do people not agree with the historical fact that Israel/Judea/Samira existed as the homeland of the Jews? Do people not know about the non-Jewish population in Israel?  Why is Zionism seen as a racist movement?
