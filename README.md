## 📖 Introduction

Reddit provides a unique lens into societal discourse, especially during critical global events. This project aims to:

- **Explore sentiment shifts** among Reddit users in response to the Israel-Palestine conflict.
- **Analyze data trends** from millions of posts and comments across relevant subreddits.
- **Bridge the gap** between computational analysis and social understanding, offering insights into how opinions evolve in digital spaces during conflicts.

## 📊 Data

Two key datasets are used in this analysis:

1. **Kaggle Dataset**:
   - Tabular dataset with over **2 million posts** from the `IsraelPalestine` and `worldnews` subreddits.
   - Captures **high-level trends** in sentiment and user activity.

2. **Raw Reddit Data**:
   - JSON-format dataset including posts and comments from the `IsraelPalestine` subreddit since **January 2023**.
   - Provides **tree-structured data** for detailed conversational dynamics.

## 🔬 Methodology

### 1. **Data Collection and Preparation**
   - **Preprocessing**: Removed irrelevant metadata for consistency and quality.
   - **Labeling**: Classified stances as **Pro-Israel**, **Pro-Palestine**, or **Neutral** using a mix of automated and manual methods.

### 2. **Fine-Tuning Language Models**
   - Leveraged models like **BERT** and **RoBERTa** for sentiment classification.
   - Explored **zero-shot** and **few-shot learning** using models like **GPT** and **Llama** for nuanced stances.

### 3. **Dynamic Social Network Analysis**
   - Built interaction networks from Reddit’s tree-structured data.
   - Mapped sentiment and stance changes across **user interactions** over time.

### 4. **Event Correlation & Timeline Analysis**
   - Cross-referenced **key global events** with user sentiment trends.
   - Analyzed **individual user timelines** to identify turning points in stances.

## 🏃 Running the Pipeline

### Steps:

1. **Preprocessing Reddit Data**  
   - Execute `clean_comments_and_submissions.py` to clean the dataset.  
   - Apply filtering using `filter_top_reddit_posts.py` to refine the data.

2. **Evaluation**  
   - Run `reddit_user_stance_analysis.py` to generate all relevant plots.  

## 🔍 Key Findings

- Significant shifts in sentiment before and after major events.
- Identification of critical dates correlating with **peaks in discourse activity**.
- Insights into how **polarized discussions propagate** in digital communities.
